## Prerequisites  
- **Tutorials:** [Add the API Proxy to a product](hcp-apim-create-product)


## Details
### You will learn  
SAP Integration Suite, API Management offers several out of the box policies which help you protect, model and "work" with your APIs. One of the security related Policies is the "Verify API Key" Policy.

In this tutorial you will learn how to protect your API Proxy with the "Verify API Key" Policy. This policy allows you to add a simple protection via a so called API Key. Only calls which send a valid API Key along with the main request will be allowed to call the API Proxy.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Learn about the API call flow)]

It is important to [understanding the API policy flow](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/06/22/part-7-understanding-api-policy-flow-routing/) so you gain an understanding of why a policy is applied at a certain time in the flow. For instance, access policies should be verified before the API call to reduce using resources unnecessarily. The entire request/response cycle is divided up, first into segments, then within each segment, into processing stages.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Learn about the Policy Editor)]

When creating a policy, you will need to know how the information is available in the policy and policy editor. [Understand how the Policy Designer accesses the proxy flow](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/06/23/part-8-understanding-the-api-policy-designer/) by reading this blog post.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Learn about how to assign a policy to a proxy)]

[Edit a policy and assign it to your proxy flow](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/06/23/part-9-assigning-policies-to-an-api-proxy/). This blog will ensure you know how to identify the proper stage to add a policy, as well as how to assign a policy to the flow.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Learn about assigning multiple policies)]

You will look at [assigning multiple policies to various processing stages](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/06/24/part-10-assigning-multiple-policies-to-an-api-proxy/), and how the outcome of one policy can be used to influence the behavior of another policy.
