## Details
### You will learn
  - How to open SAP standard app like Mobile Cards from MDK public store client
  - How to open a web page

You may clone an existing project from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-mdk-tutorial-samples/tree/master/4-Level-Up-with-the-Mobile-Development-Kit/4-Implement-Deep-Linking-to-Another-App-from-an-MDK-App) and start directly with step 5 in this tutorial.

---

Deep links are used to send users directly to an app instead of a website or a store saving users the time and energy locating a particular page themselves â€“ significantly improving the user experience.

If an app is already installed, you can specify a custom URL scheme (iOS Universal Links) or an intent URL (on Android devices) that opens that app. Using deep link, you can also navigate to specific events or pages, which could tie into campaigns that you may want to run.

>**This tutorial has been executed using public store MDK client which has out of the box functionality to open the SAP standard app like SAP Mobile Cards.
If you are building a custom version of Mobile development kit client, there you can implement deep links by specifying related custom URL scheme.**

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create a new MDK project in SAP Business Application Studio)]

1. Launch the [Dev space](cp-mobile-bas-setup) in SAP Business Application Studio.

2. Click **Start from template** on Welcome page.

    !![MDK](img-1.2.png)

    >If you do not see the Welcome page, you can access it via **Help** menu or via **View** menu > Find Command > Welcome.

3. Select **MDK Project** and click **Start**.

    !![MDK](img-1.3.png)  

    >If you do not see the **MDK Project** option check if your Dev Space has finished loading or reload the page in your browser and try again.

4. In *Basic Information* step, select or provide the below information and click **Finish**:

    | Field | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `MDK Template Type`| Select `Empty` from the dropdown |
    | `Your Project Name` | Provide a name of your choice. `MDKDeepLink` is used for this tutorial |
    | `Your Application Name` | <default name is same as project name, you can provide any name of your choice> |
    | `Target MDK Client Version` | Leave the default selection as `MDK 6.0+ (For use with MDK 6.0 or later clients)` |    
    | `Choose a target folder` | By default, the target folder uses project root path. However, you can choose a different folder path |

    !![MDK](img-1.4.png)

    >The _MDK Empty Project_ template creates a Logout action, Close page action, rule and an empty page (`Main.page`). After using this template, you can focus on creating your pages, other actions, and rules needed for your application. More details on _MDK template_ is available in [help documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/getting-started/mdk/webide.html#creating-a-new-project).

5. After clicking **Finish**, the wizard will generate your MDK Application based on your selections. You should now see the `MDKDeepLink` project in the project explorer.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create a new rule)]

In the MDK editor, you will first create a message to display a confirmation dialog if user wants to leave the current app and then will create 2 new Rule files:

  * `OpenSAPMobileCards.js` to open SAP Mobile Cards app
  * `OpenSAPcom.js` to open `SAP.com` web page

  >You can find more details about [writing a Rule](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/getting-started/mdk/development/rules.html).

1. Right-click the **Actions** folder | **MDK: New Action** | choose **MDK Message Actions** in **Category** | click **Message Action** | **Next**.

    !![MDK](img_1.1.png)

    Provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Action Name`| `Confirmation` |
    | `Type` | Select `Message` from the dropdown |
    | `Message` | `Do you want to leave the current app?` |
    | `Title` | `Confirm` |
    | `OKCaption` | `OK` |
    | `OnOK` | `--None--` |
    | `CancelCaption` | `CANCEL` |
    | `OnCancel` | `--None--` |

1. Right-click the **Rules** folder | **MDK: New Rule File** | select **Empty JS Rule**.

    !![MDK](img_2.0.png)

2. Enter the Rule name `OpenSAPMobileCards`, press `Enter`.

    !![MDK](img_2.1.png)

    Replace the generated snippet with below code.

    ```JavaScript
    export default function OpenSAPMobileCards(context) {
        // Get the Nativescript Utils Module
        const utilsModule = context.nativescript.utilsModule;
        return context.executeAction('/MDKDeepLink/Actions/Confirmation.action').then((result) => {
            if (result.data) {
                //This will open SAP Mobile Cards app
                return utilsModule.openUrl("com.sap.content2go://");
            } else {
                return Promise.reject('User Deferred');
            }
        });
    }
    ```
    !![MDK](img_2.2.png)

    >`openUrl` is a `NativeScript` API to open an URL on device. You can find more details about [this API](https://v6.docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/utils#openurl-function).

3. Save your changes to the `OpenSAPMobileCards.js` file.

4. Create one more Rule file and name it to `OpenSAPcom`.

    Replace the generated snippet with below code.

    ```JavaScript
    export default function OpenSAPcom(context) {
        // Get the Nativescript Utils Module
        const utilsModule = context.nativescript.utilsModule;
        return context.executeAction('/MDKDeepLink/Actions/Confirmation.action').then((result) => {
            if (result.data) {
                //This will open SAP.com website
                return utilsModule.openUrl("https://www.sap.com");
            } else {
                return Promise.reject('User Deferred');
            }
        });
    }
    ```

    !![MDK](img_2.8.png)

5. Save your changes to the `OpenSAPcom.js` file.

[DONE]
