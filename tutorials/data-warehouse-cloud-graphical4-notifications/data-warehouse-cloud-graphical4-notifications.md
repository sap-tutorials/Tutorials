[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Get to know the information bubbles)]

You will see the blue information bubbles in case of changes or updates to your data models.

For example, if an underlying source table used in your view has been changed, you will see a notification bubble. With these bubbles, it is easy for you to see when any changes have been made.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Get to know the warning bubbles)]

You will see the orange warning bubbles when changes or actions may cause issues.
For example, if you save a data flow without the final output table or with a branch that is not connected to any outputs, this would prompt a warning. These bubbles say: This may not work â€“ proceed with caution!

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Get to know the error bubbles)]

Finally, red error bubbles highlight errors and situations that need your intervention.

Some of the examples create an impossible join condition or having a syntax error in a formula.

> Please note from release `2021.10` on, a new version history is created each time a model is successfully deployed. Those versions can be retrieved through a specific endpoint.
