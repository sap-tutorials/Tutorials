4. Provide the **token endpoint URL** in Postman URL from the **Service Keys** for the protocol type HTTPREST.

    Build the postman URL by appending the `GRANTTYPE` as **CLIENTCREDENTIALS** and `RESPONSETYPE` as **token**

    So the final postman URL should look like this:

```
<<tokenendpoint>>?grant_type=client_credentials&response_type=token

<<tokenendpoint>> is to be replaced with the 'tokenendpoint' field of the service key.
In the Headers tab, enter `Content-Type` as KEY and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` as VALUE.

```
