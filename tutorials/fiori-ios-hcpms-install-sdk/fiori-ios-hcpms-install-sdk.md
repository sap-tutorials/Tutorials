### Store SDK files locally


Download the `SAP_BTP_for_iOS_PKG_release` zip file . Unzip it and double-click the pkg file to install. Follow the installation instructions.

The application `SAP BTP SDK Assistant for iOS`  will be installed to the local `Applications` folder.

> The Assistant is a macOS app that rapidly generates object-oriented Swift proxy classes for OData services, eliminating exposure to low-level APIs. The Assistant also generates Mobile Services configuration and creates a ready to run Xcode project for iPhone or iPad.

The **SAP BTP SDK Assistant for iOS** will be covered in detail in one of the next tutorials.

>If you have used version 1.0 of the **SAP BTP SDK for iOS** before, you may have noticed the `Frameworks`, `Tools` and `Documentation` folders are no longer available. These can now all be accessed from the SAP BTP SDK Assistant for iOS's **App menu**.

>It is not necessary to extract the frameworks but if is needed then click **Export Frameworks**, select a folder where you wish the frameworks to be exported.
