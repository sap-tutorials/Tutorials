You need a tenant and a user with administrator role. For more information, please refer to the tutorial [Create User and Tenant](iot-cf-create-user-tenant).

You have to create a device model for the Internet of Things Service using the Device Management API. For detailed information about the entities of a device model, please refer to section [Device Model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/2f1daa938df84fd090fa2a4da6e4bc05/Cloud/en-US/41c5d53fee864f2482b965cf4127a730.html) in the **Introduction**.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create a Capability)]

In the following, a capability is created. A capability can be reused since it can be assigned to multiple sensor types. Each capability can have one or many properties.

1.  Open the Device Management API:

    `http://<HOST_NAME>/<INSTANCE_ID>/iot/core/api/v1/doc/`

    You will see the main page with the categories overview.

2.  Choose **Authorize**.

3.  Enter your user credentials.

4.  Choose **Authorize**.

5.  In the **Capabilities** category, choose the `POST /tenant/{tenantId}/capabilities` request.

6.  Choose **Try it out**.

7.  In the `tenantId field`, enter the ID of your tenant.

8.  Copy the **JSON string** and replace `{capabilityName}` with your capability name, replace `{propertyName}` with property name, replace `{dataTypeName}` with the data type for the property, and replace `{unitOfMeasureName}` with the unit of the measure.

    ```JSON
    {
      "name": "{capabilityName}",
      "properties": [
       {
          "name" : "{propertyName}",
          "dataType" : "{dataTypeName}",
          "unitOfMeasure" : "{unitOfMeasureName}"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    >Supported data types are: integer, long, float, double, boolean, string, binary, and date. For more information, please refer to section [Device Model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/2f1daa938df84fd090fa2a4da6e4bc05/Cloud/en-US/41c5d53fee864f2482b965cf4127a730.html) in the **Introduction**.

9.  Paste the modified **JSON string** in the **Example Value** field for the POST request.

    ```JSON
    {
    "name": "MyCapability",
      "properties": [
        {
          "name" : "LED",
          "dataType" : "boolean"
        },
        {
          "name" : "Buzzer",
          "dataType" : "boolean"
        },
        {
          "name" : "Speed",
          "dataType" : "float",
          "unitOfMeasure" : "mph"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

10.  Choose **Execute**.

11.  Scroll to the **Server response** body and **Code**. In case of success the response code is `200` and the **Response body** contains all information of the created capability.

    ```JSON
    {
      "id": "3772113f-d8bf-4dc5-9968-847845b8e8ee",
      "name": "MyCapability",

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Generate the Device Certificate)]

**Prerequisites:**

You have installed OpenSSL. A description on how to install OpenSSL can be found in the tutorial [Install OpenSSL](iot-cf-install-openssl).

1.  Log on to the Internet of Things Service Cockpit with your user credentials.

    `https://<HOST_NAME>/<INSTANCE_ID>/iot/cockpit/`

2.  On the **My Tenants** page, select a tenant first.

3.  Use the main menu to navigate to the **Devices** section of the **Device Management** category.

    All devices are listed.

4.  Choose the previously created device.

5.  On the device details page, choose the **Certificate** tab.

6.  In the **Generate Certificate** dialog, select the type of certificate you want to generate. For this tutorial, please use `pem`

    >Supported types are PEM and P12. Based on the certificate type you choose, the system downloads a `*-device_certificate.pem` or `*-device_certificate.p12` and a dialog opens, which shows the **Secret** key.

7. Choose **Generate**.

8.  Select and copy the displayed **Secret** key before closing the dialog or leaving the page, as it cannot be restored at a later point in time.

9.  Rename `*-device_certificate.pem` to `certificate.pem`.

10.  Open the console in the directory where the previously downloaded `*.pem` file is located. Enter the following command in the terminal:

    `openssl pkcs12 -export -in certificate.pem -inkey certificate.pem -out client.ks`

    >Use the copied **Secret** key from the previous step for all password requests (import pass phrase and Export Password).

    A file named `client.ks` is created.
