## Prerequisites
- You have the knowledge on ingesting data and generating models with SAP AI Core, from [this tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/ai-core-data.html/#)

## Details
### You will learn
- How to log simple metrics on validation data and training data
- How to log step information along with metrics
- How to log custom metrics structure

By the end of the tutorial you will be able to use SAP AI Launchpad to compare two models that have been generated with SAP AI Core. This tutorial builds on the previous tutorials on house price prediction and ingesting data.

> Important: Comparing functionality is only available the SAP AI Launchpad interface, and not the API endpoints. However, this step is optional.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Starter code)]

Create a folder named `hello-aicore-metrics`. Within it, create a file called `main.py`, and paste the following starter code to this file.

```PYTHON
import os
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, train_test_split
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance
from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd
from ai_core_sdk.models import Metric, MetricTag, MetricCustomInfo, MetricLabel
#
# Logging Metrics: SAP AI Core connection (Step 2)
# <PASTE CODE HERE>
#
# Variables
DATA_PATH = '/app/data/train.csv'
DT_MAX_DEPTH= int(os.getenv('DT_MAX_DEPTH'))
MODEL_PATH = '/app/model/model.pkl'
#
# Load Datasets
df = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH)
X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']
#
# Metric Logging: Basic (Step 3)
# <PASTE CODE HERE>
#
# Partition into Train and test dataset
train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)
#
# K-fold
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, random_state=31, shuffle=True)
i = 0 # storing step count
for train_index, val_index in kf.split(train_x):
    i += 1
    # Train model on subset
    clf = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=DT_MAX_DEPTH, random_state=31)
    clf.fit(train_x.iloc[train_index], train_y.iloc[train_index])
    # Score on validation data (hold-out dataset)
    val_step_r2 = clf.score(train_x.iloc[val_index], train_y.iloc[val_index])
    # Metric Logging: Step Information (Step 4)
    # <PASTE CODE HERE>
    # Delete step model
    del(clf)
#
# Final Model
clf = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=DT_MAX_DEPTH, random_state=31)
clf.fit(train_x, train_y)
# Scoring over test data
test_r2_score = clf.score(test_x, test_y)
# Metric Logging: Attaching to metrics to generated model (Step 5)
# <PASTE CODE HERE>
#
# Model Explaination
r = permutation_importance(
    clf, test_x, test_y,
    n_repeats=30,
    random_state=0
)
# Feature importances
feature_importances = str('')
for i in r.importances_mean.argsort()[::-1]:
    feature_importances += f"{df.columns[i]}: {r.importances_mean[i]:.3f} +/- {r.importances_std[i]:.3f} \n"
# Metric Logging: Custom Structure (Step 6)
# <PASTE CODE HERE>
#
# Save model
import pickle
pickle.dump(clf, open(MODEL_PATH, 'wb'))
#
# Metric Logging: Tagging the execution (Step 7)
# <PASTE CODE HERE>
```

> Note that the snippet includes some place holders that say `# <PASTE CODE HERE>`. We complete these entries throughout the tutorial. For clarity, the comments in the code also include the relevant step number.

This Python script contains all of the modifications needed for logging metrics, meaning that you can leave your previous workflows as they are.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Add connection)]

Add the following connection snippet. The initialization value of `base_url=''` - an empty string - is mandatory, as it indicates the code should be connected to the SAP AI Core environment.

```PYTHON
from ai_core_sdk.ai_core_v2_client import AICoreV2Client
aic_connection = AICoreV2Client(base_url='') # DO NOT Change, the value is intentionally passed as empty string, When this code will run inside SAP AI Core then the values will be auto-populated
...
```

> **CAUTION**: The above code is very similar to the code used to connect the SAP AI Core SDK to your local system. However, here it is required to establish connection within the SAP AI Core execution environment.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Add Basic metric logging)]

Add the following snippet to log the number of observations in your dataset.

```PYTHON
aic_connection.metrics.log_metrics(
    metrics = [
        Metric(
            name= "N_observations", value= float(df.shape[0]), timestamp=datetime.utcnow()),
    ]
)
```

This reflects, after execution, as shown in SAP AI Launchpad, please zoom in to view.

!![image](img/ail/basic.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Step information)]

Add the following snippet to store the metrics on step information. This snippet is also useful for tracking the metrics on epochs of the training process.

```PYTHON
aic_connection.metrics.log_metrics(
    metrics = [
        Metric(name= "(Val) Fold R2", value= float(val_step_r2), timestamp=datetime.utcnow(), step=i),
    ]
)
```

The variable `i` in is already present in your code to pass to the parameter `step=i`. This reflects as shown in SAP AI Launchpad, when executed. Please zoom in to view.

!![image](img/ail/step.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Attach metrics to generated model)]

Add the following snippet to store metrics on step information.

```PYTHON
aic_connection.metrics.log_metrics(
    metrics = [
        Metric(
            name= "Test data R2",
            value= float(test_r2_score),
            timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
            labels= [
                MetricLabel(name="metrics.ai.sap.com/Artifact.name", value="housepricemodel")
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

The parameter `value="housepricemodel"` refers to the artifact name, which references the model that will be stored in AWS S3. It is vital that the name of this parameter matches the name that you defined in your YAML workflow.

Your code should resemble:

!![image](img/ail/modelA.png)

This reflects as shown in SAP AI Launchpad, when executed:
!![image](img/ail/modelB.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Custom Metrics for model inspection)]

Add the following snippet to store metrics based on a customized structure.

```PYTHON
aic_connection.metrics.set_custom_info(
    custom_info= [
        MetricCustomInfo(name= "Feature Importance (verbose)", value=  str(r)),
        MetricCustomInfo(name= "Feature Importance (brief)", value= feature_importances )
    ]
)
```

The structure must be type-cast to `str` (string). Here, the structure used is [**permutation feature importance**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html#permutation-importance).

The variables `r` and `feature_importances` are already created in the starter code.

This reflects as shown in SAP AI Launchpad, when executed:

!![image](img/ail/custom.png)

> ### Permutation Feature Importance
>
> Sources: [`Scikit Learn Python Package`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html#permutation-importance)
>
> What it is?
>
> - Indicates, for a given target, model, dataset and task, how much the model depends on a given feature.
> - Gives an empirical estimate of how much loss is attributed to the removal of a given feature.
>
> What it is not:
>
> - A model, dataset or task agnostic indication of the importance of a given feature. While the method is agnostic, the results are applicable only to the specific input combination.
> - A perfectly accurate indication of the importance of a given feature for a specific prediction. While this is the goal of the method, it does not account for weaknesses in the model.
>
> Advantages:
>
> - Model agnostic,
> - provides global `explainability` - meaning that it estimates each feature's importance to the prediction task.
> - contributes to model transparency.
> - The method or function used to measure "error" can be customized, with reference to `scikit` package implementation.


[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Tags for execution meta after training)]

Add the following snippet to tag you execution. The `tags` are customizable key-values.

```PYTHON
aic_connection.metrics.set_tags(
    tags= [
        MetricTag(name="Validation Method Used", value= "K-Fold"), # your custom name and value
        MetricTag(name="Metrics", value= "R2"),
    ]
)
```

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 9: ](Create configuration and execution)]

Create a configuration using the following information. The information is taken from the workflow from previous steps. For a reminder of how to create a configuration, see step 11 of [this tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/ai-core-data.html/#).

|  | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Configuration Name | House Price (Jan) metrics |
| Scenario Name | `House Price (Tutorial)`
| Version | `2.0`
| Executable Name | `training-metrics`
| Scenario ID | `learning-datalines`
| Executable ID | `house-metrics-train`

The value for `Input Parameters` `DT_MAX_DEPTH` is your choice. Until now, this was set using an environment variable. If no variable is specified, this parameter will continue to be defined by the environment variables.

> Information: This parameter can be defined using an integer to set a maximum depth or as `None`, which means that nodes are expanded until all leaves are single nodes, or contain all contain fewer data points than specified in the `min_samples_split samples`, if specified. For more information, see [the Scikit learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html\#)

Attach your registered artifact to `Input Artifact`, by specifying `housedataset` for this value.

Create an execution from this configuration.
