# Set Up SAP Business Application Studio for Low-Code Development in the Trial Environment
<!-- description --> SAP Business Application Studio is a development environment available on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). This tutorial describes how to perform the onboarding steps for SAP Business Application Studio in the SAP BTP Trial environment. In addition, you learn how to create an SAP Business Application Studio dev space for low-code-based full-stack cloud application development so you can build low-code applications.

## Prerequisites
 - You have an SAP BTP Trial account ([Get a Free Account on SAP BTP Trial](hcp-create-trial-account))

## You will learn
- How to set up SAP Business Application Studio in the SAP BTP Trial environment
- How to access the SAP Business Application Studio dev space manager page
- How to create an SAP Business Application Studio dev space for low-code-based full-stack cloud application development

## Intro
After completing the steps in this tutorial, you will have set up SAP Business Application Studio on the **SAP BTP Trial environment**. In addition, you will have created a dev space for low-code-based full-stack cloud application development so you can build low-code applications.

>**Please note:** For the SAP BTP Trial environment, the Low-Code Tools and the Low-Code dev space type are only available on the US East (VA) data center (us10).


>If you want to onboard and access SAP Business Application Studio in an **SAP BTP Enterprise Account** there are two options: it can be obtained through manual subscription, or by using a subscription booster. Boosters are a set of guided interactive steps that enable you to select, configure, and consume services on SAP BTP to achieve a specific technical goal. For more information about SAP BTP boosters, see [Boosters] (https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/fb1b56148f834749a2bf51127421610b.html?q=btp%20booster).

### Create a preconfigured dev space

    >Dev spaces are like isolated environments in the cloud containing tailored tools and preinstalled runtimes per business scenario, such as SAP Fiori, SAP S/4HANA extensions, Workflow, Mobile and more. This simplifies and saves time in setting up the development environment as there is no need to install anything or upgrade, letting developers focus on their business domain, anytime, anywhere. For further information on dev spaces refer to [Dev Spaces in SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/6053df8bca3946f098bc9f89e49d7317.html)

1. If you have not created a dev space yet, choose **Create Dev Space** in the landing page of SAP Business Application Studio. If you have already created a dev space, choose **Create Dev Space** in the dev space manager.

    <!-- border -->![Create Dev Space](BAS-Dev-Space-Manager-Empty-.png)

2. Choose a name for your dev space.

3. Choose **Low-Code-Based Full-Stack Cloud Application** as the application type.

    >The **Low-Code-Based Full-Stack Cloud Application** dev space allows you to easily develop, test, build, and deploy apps using the Low Code Application Platform.

4. Choose **Create Dev Space**.

    <!-- border -->![Create Dev Space](BAS-select-devspace.png)

    The creation of the dev space takes a while. You see that the status for your dev space will change from **STARTING** to **RUNNING**.

5. Once the dev space is running, click the dev space name to open it.
