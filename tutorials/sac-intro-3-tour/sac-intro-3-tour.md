## Getting Around SAP Analytics Cloud
After signing into SAP Analytics Cloud, you will see features and applications that can help you increase your work efficiency and productivity. These tools and applications are divided into three main parts.

![Get to know SAC](Get to know SAC.png)


1. Your personal **home screen** is the first page you see after signing into to SAP Analytics Cloud. You can personalize this page to suit your work style and needs and even pin visualizations to monitor specific key performance indicators better. We'll go over the home screen in more detail in the next section.

2. The **side navigation** on the left is made up of single-click entry points, allowing you access to features such as viewing and creating content. You can collapse or expand the navigation menu or enter full-screen display for viewing certain content.

3. The **shell bar** is the uppermost horizontal section and consists of a breadcrumb navigation, allowing you to know where you are in your workspace and lets you easily navigate to any part of the folder path for your current file, and universal actions such as search, search to insight, notifications, discussions, help, and profile.

### Personal Home Screen


Your home screen makes it easy for you to access recent Stories, Files, and Analytic Applications and display Featured Files and Recent Files as tiles. You can also pin important visualizations from stories to your home screen. Pinning visualizations help you easily monitor your key performance indicators, and they also act as shortcuts back to the stories.

![Home Screen](Home Screen.png)

You can personalize your home screen by selecting tiles to display or hiding and rearranging them by dragging them around the home screen. To edit the home screen and select your tiles, click on your Profile avatar in the upper-right corner and select Home Screen Settings. You can choose a default home screen tab, customize the display background and logo displayed, and add or remove tiles from the Home screen.

> We will demonstrate how to pin visualizations to the home screen in another tutorial.

#### Today, Catalog, Favorites, and Share with Me Tabs

You can toggle between four tabs on the Home Screen:

- **Today**: This is the default tab and shows your home screen
- **Catalog**: Single access point for content published for users
- **Favorites**: Lists the resources you have "starred" as your favorite
- **Shared With Me**: Lists all the resources shared with you by other users


### Sidebar Navigation


The sidebar navigation is where you access the main applications and features of SAP Analytics Cloud including Stories, Analytic Applications, Modeling, Data Analyzer, Digital Boardroom, and more. It is located on the left side of the page and can be collapsed and expanded. The navigation bar will always be present, no matter what application you are working in, making it quick and easy for you to switch between different applications.

> The options that you see in your side navigation is dependent on your standard application role and permission access. Administrators have full access to all the content creation and administration tools, whereas analytic consumers see a simpler menu with a reduced set of items.

### The Shell Bar


The shell bar lets you see the breadcrumb navigation and actions relating to the active screen. It also contains universal features including search, search to insight, notifications, discussions, help, user profile settings, and the product switch. With the shell bar, you will have a consistent experience across all SAP Analytics Cloud products.
