[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create a workspace)]

A workspace is a membership of users who can upload, create, or reference material specific to a department, project, or team. Within a workspace you can communicate, interact easily, share knowledge with other members, and easily access the workspace-related information that you need from a single place.

1. In your work zone, click **Workspaces** in the top-level menu, and then click **New Workspace**.

    !![Create workspace](1-create-new-workspace.png)

2. Select **No Template** from the dropdown list of available templates.

    !![Select template](2-select-template.png)

    >You can also select one of SAP's out-of-the-box templates. In this case, you'll get a professionally designed overview page with widgets including everything you need to get started quickly. You can then customize the content to suit your needs. For this tutorial we will not use a template.

3. Enter this name for your workspace: `Employee Innovation Hackathon`.

    >Tip: Always use a name that would help users distinguish your workspace from others.

4. Copy and paste this description for your workspace: `Get together and find the answers to your questions about the hackathon!`

5. Select `Private`.

    >Selecting private makes your workspace available to a specific set of members that you've invited to the workspace. If you later want to make it public so that everyone in the company can see it, click **Edit Workspace Settings** at the top of your screen and change the setting to `Public`.

6. Click **Create**.

    !![New workspace settings](3-new-workspace-settings.png)

Your workspace is created.


[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Join the workspace)]

When you create your workspace, you are prompted to define the frequency of email notifications.

1. Select **Daily** to get any updates to the workspace every day.

2. Click **Accept** to ensure that you've joined the workspace.

  !![Define workspace settings](3a-created-workspace.png)

You can now start building your workspace.

!![Start building a workspace](3c-start-building.png)

> When you want to access your workspace later, you can look for it under the **Workspaces** menu item by selecting **View All Workspaces**. You'll see all the workspaces that you have permissions to access.
  !![View all workspaces](3b-view-workspace.png)

Now, let's add content to the workspace.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Change the image in the workspace header)]

When you create a new workspace the header has a dark and light blue background. You can replace this background with your own.

1. Hover over the background in the workspace header to expose the  **Upload cover photo** icon and click it.

    !![New cover photo](4-new-header-image.png)

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Create an Overview page for your workspace)]

The **Overview** page is the first thing people see when they join your workspace. You can use it to present the workspace purpose, feature workspace members, and display workspace-related content. With the built-in Page Designer, you can add widgets and create multiple pages to help organize and enable users to quickly find the workspace-related information they need.

1. Click **+** to add a page tab.

    !![Add page tab](6-add-page-tab.png)
