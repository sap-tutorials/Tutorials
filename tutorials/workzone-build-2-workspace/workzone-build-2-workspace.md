# Add a Workspace to SAP Work Zone
<!-- description --> Create a workspace and add content to it that you can share with other members of your workspace.

## Prerequisites
- You have an environment set up and you can access your SAP Work Zone.
&nbsp;
**Note that SAP Work Zone is not available in a trial account.**


## You will learn
  - How to create a new workspace
  - How to add content to it and design the layout

## Intro
In this tutorial, you're going to create a workspace where employees who joined the company hackathon challenge, can interact with other members of the workspace, ask questions, and find out all that they need to know.



### Download images for your workspace


Before you start, download these image files so that they're on your computer ready for you to add to your workpage for the workspace that you will create.

- [`workspace_row2_image1.jpg`](Workspace_Images/workspace_row2_image1.jpg)
- [`workspace_row2_image2.jpg`](Workspace_Images/workspace_row2_image2.jpg)
- [`workspace_header_image.jpg`](Workspace_Images/workspace_header_image.jpg)
- [`workspace_image_with_icon1.png`](Workspace_Images/workspace_image_with_icon1.png)
- [`workspace_image_with_icon2.png`](Workspace_Images/workspace_image_with_icon2.png)
- [`workspace_image_with_icon3.png`](Workspace_Images/workspace_image_with_icon3.png)
- [`workspace_image_with_icon4.png`](Workspace_Images/workspace_image_with_icon4.png)



### Create a workspace


Workspaces are the building blocks of SAP Work Zone. You can add all kinds of content to it and you can invite other users to join as members.

1. In your work zone, click **Workspaces** in the top-level menu, and then click **New Workspace**.

    <!-- border -->![Create workspace](1-create-new-workspace.png)

2. Select **No Template** from the dropdown list of available templates.

    <!-- border -->![Select template](2-select-template.png)

    >You can also select one of SAP's out-of-the-box templates. In this case, you'll get a professionally designed workpage with widgets including everything you need to get started quickly. You can then customize the content to suit your needs. For this tutorial you won't use a template.

3. Enter this name for your workspace: `Employee Innovation Hackathon`. In workshops, use: `<your unique identifier>_Employee Innovation Hackathon`.

    >**Tip:** Always use a name that would help users distinguish your workspace from others.



4. Copy and paste this description for your workspace: `Get together and find the answers to your questions about the hackathon!`

5. Select `Private`.

    >Selecting private makes your workspace available to a specific set of members that you've invited to the workspace. If you later want to make it public so that everyone in the company can see it, click **Edit Workspace Settings** at the top of your screen and change the setting to `Public`.

6. Click **Create**.

    <!-- border -->![New workspace settings](3-new-workspace-settings.png)

Your workspace is created.



### Configure your workspace notifications


When you create your workspace, you are prompted to define the frequency of email notifications.

1. Select **Daily** to get any updates to the workspace every day.

2. Click **Accept** to ensure that you've joined the workspace.

  <!-- border -->![Define workspace settings](3a-created-workspace.png)

You can now start building your workspace.

<!-- border -->![Start building a workspace](3c-start-building.png)

Now, let's add content to the workspace.


### Change the image in the workspace header


When you create a new workspace, the header has a dark and light blue background. You can replace this background with your own.

1. Hover over the background in the workspace header to expose the  **Edit cover photo** button and select **Upload Photo**.

    <!-- border -->![New cover photo](4-new-header-image.png)

2. Browse for the following image that you downloaded: `worspace_header-image`.

3. Reposition your photo to display it as you want, and then click **Save**.

    <!-- border -->![Save cover image](5-save-cover-image.png)





### Create a workpage for your workspace


In this step, you'll add a workpage to your workspace - it will describe the purpose of the workspace and will feature relevant content.

1. Click **+** to add a page tab.

    <!-- border -->![Add page tab](6-add-page-tab.png)

2. From the **Add New Page** screen, select the **Workpage** tile.

    <!-- border -->![Add overview page](7-select-overview-page.png)

3. Select the blank layout at the bottom right of the screen and click **OK**. The Page Designer is now active.

    <!-- border -->![Select layout](8-select-layout.png)


5. Enter a title for the workpage: `About the Hackathon`.

    <!-- border -->![Title of overview page](9-name-overview-page.png)




### Design the first row of your workpage


In this step, you'll add two text widgets next to each other in the first row of the workpage.

1. Click **Add Widget** in the first row to open the widget gallery.

    <!-- border -->![Add widget](10-add-widget1.png)

2. Select the **Text** widget.

    <!-- border -->![Add text widget](11-select-text-widget.png)

3. Design the **Text** widget as follows:

    |  :------------- | :-------------
    | Text            | Type in the following: `Approach our experts with all your questions`.
    | Font            | Select the text and change to Arial 14pt.
    | Color           | With the text already selected, choose black from the chart.

    <!-- border -->![Design text widget](12-design-text-widget.png)

4. On the right side of the widget that you've just added, click the  **+** to add another column.

    <!-- border -->![Add second widget](13-add-second-widget.png)

5. Click **Add Widget** in the second column and select the **Text** widget.

6. Design the **Text** widget as follows:

    |  :------------- | :-------------
    | Text            | Type in the following: `More Information`
    | Font            | Select the text and change to Arial 14pt.
    | Color           | With the text already selected, choose black from the chart.

7. This is what your first row looks like:

    <!-- border -->![Preview of row 1](13a-preview-row1.png)



### Design the second row of your workpage


In this step, you'll add images to the second row.

1. Click the **+** under the first row to add a new row.

    <!-- border -->![Add a second row](14-add-second-row.png)

2. In the second row, click **Add Widget**.

4. Click the link in the widget to browse for the image that you saved on your computer: `workspace_row2_image 1`

    ![Empty image widget](16a-empty-image-widget.png)

5. Click the cog icon in the top right of the image to edit the image.

    <!-- border -->![Open image settings](17-open-settings.png)

6. Design the **Image** widget as follows:

    |  :-------------     | :-------------
    | Caption             | `Carla Grant, IT Expert`
    | Caption Layout      | Inline
    | Caption Alignment   | Left

7. Click **Save**.

    <!-- border -->![Define widget settings](18-define-widget-settings.png)

8. On the right side of this widget, click the **+** to add a new column.

    <!-- border -->![Add column](19-add-column.png)

9. Click **Add Widget** in the new column, select the **Image** widget, and then click the link in the widget to add this image that you saved on your computer: `workspace_row2_image2`.

10. On the top right of the widget that you've just added, click the cog icon to edit your image.

    <!-- border -->![Open settings for second image widget](20-define-settings-image2.png)

11.  Design the second **Image** widget as follows and then click **Save**:

    |  :-------------     | :-------------
    | Caption             | `Michael Hill, ML Expert`
    | Caption Layout      | Inline
    | Caption Alignment   | Left

12. Click **+** next to the second image widget to open a third column.

    <!-- border -->![Add another column](21-add-another-column.png)

13. Add the following 4 image widgets one under each other in the third column. Keep clicking **Add Widget** and select an image each time until you've added all these images:

    |  :-------------     | :-------------
    | First image         | `workspace_image_with_icon1`
    | Second image        | `workspace_image_with_icon2`
    | Third image         | `workspace_image_with_icon3`

    <!-- border -->![Add widget 4 times](21a-add-widgetx4.png)


14. Click the cog icon at the top right of the first image widget and design as follows. When you're done, click **Save**.

    |  :-------------     | :-------------                
    | Caption             |`Real Customer Challenges`
    | Caption Layout      |Overlay
    | Background Opacity  |0%
    | Caption Alignment   |Left

15. In the same way, design the other 3 images as follows. When you're done click **Save** each time:

    |  :-------------     | :-------------                
    | Caption             | Second image: `Product Documentation`<div>&nbsp;</div><div>Third image: `Submission Criteria`<div>&nbsp;</div><div>Fourth image: `Stay Involved`
    | Link To        |Add this link to the **second** image widget that you named `Product Documentation`: <https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/WZ/Cloud/en-US> <div>&nbsp;</div><div> Once you've published your site you can click on this image to open the SAP Work Zone documentation product page.
    | Caption Layout        |All images: Overlay
    | Background Opacity    |All images: 0%
    | Caption Alignment     |All images: Left


16. See how your workpage looks so far:

    <!-- border -->![First preview](22-first-preview.png)

17. To increase the spacing between this row and the first row, hover over the row to expose the row settings on the right, and click the cog icon to edit the row.


    <!-- border -->![Edit row](22a-edit-row-settings.png)

18. Under **Padding Top**, add the value `30` pixels and click **Save**.

    <!-- border -->![Edit row pixels](22b-edit-pixels.png)


### Design the third and last row of your workspace


In this step, you'll add an **Action** widget, a **Forum** widget, and a **Feed** widget.

1. Click **+** at the bottom of the second row to add another row.

    <!-- border -->![Add the third row](22a-add-third-row.png)

2. Click **Add Widget**.

3. Select the **Action** widget.

    >Adding an **Action** widget enables workspace members to choose from a selection of commonly used action types. In this tutorial, we want the workspace members to ask questions or add ideas.

    <!-- border -->![Add an action widget](23-add-action-widget.png)

4. Enter the **Widget Title**: `Add your Hackathon Questions & Ideas`.

5. Uncheck all options except for **Ask a Question** and **Add an Idea**. Click **Save** to add the widget to your overview page.

    <!-- border -->![Design actions widget](24-design-actions-widget.png)

    Now let's create the **Forum** widget.

6. Click the **+** next to the widget you just created to add another column.

    <!-- border -->![Add another column](25-add-another-column.png)

7. Click **Add Widget**.

    <!-- border -->![Add a widget to 2nd column](25a-add-widget.png)

8. Select the **Forum** widget.

    > Adding a **Forum** widget enables a workspace member to view questions, ideas, and discussions submitted by their workspace members.

    <!-- border -->![Add a forum widget](26-add-forum-widget.png)

9. Under **Maximum Items to Display**, move the slider to number **2**, change the title to `Ask Questions About the Hackathon`, and click **OK**.

    > On the overview page, only 2 of the questions, ideas or discussions from the forum will be displayed.  

    <!-- border -->![Design the forum widget](27-design-forum-widget.png)


    Now let's add the **Feed** widget.

10. In the same row, directly under the **Action** widget that you added, click **Add Widget**.

    <!-- border -->![Add another widget](27-add-another-widget.png)

11. Select the **Feed** widget and keep the default setting to show all events in the feed.  Click **Save**.

    You've now added all three widgets.

13. To increase the spacing between this row and the row above, hover over the row to expose the row settings on the right, click **Edit row settings**.

    <!-- border -->![Edit row settings](28-edit-row-settings.png)

14. Under **Row Padding**, add the value `30`pixels in the **Top** value box and click **Save**.

15. Click **Save Draft** to save a draft version of your overview page.

    <!-- border -->![Save as draft](28-save-as-draft.png)



### Add a forums tab and ask a question


Apart from the **Forum** widget, you're going to add a dedicated **Forum** page tab. From this page, workspace members can see all the questions, ideas and discussions in the forums that have been created for the workspace.

1. Click the **+** next to the **About the Hackathon** workpage.

    <!-- border -->![Add new page tab](28-add-new-page.png)

2.  In the **Add New Page** screen, under the **Content** category, select **Forums** to add the **Forums**  page tab to your workspace. The forum page tab opens a screen displaying all the different forum topics.

    Now ask a question in the forum.

3. Go back to your workpage by clicking the **About the Hackathon** workpage.

    <!-- border -->![Go back to overview page](29-go-to-overview-page.png)

4. Scroll down to your **Actions** widget that you added previously and click **Ask a question**.

    <!-- border -->![Add new question](35-add-a-question.png)

2. Add this question: `What time does the hackathon start?` Then click **Publish** so that members will be able to see your question. You'll get a confirmation message that your question was created.

    <!-- border -->![Add first questions](35-first-question.png)

3. Go back to your workspace by using the breadcrumbs at the top.

    <!-- border -->![Go back to Forums page](35a-go-back.png)

You can see that your question has been added to your overview page as well as to your feed.

<!-- border -->![View question](36-view-questions.png)




### Publish and view your workspace


  1. Now **Publish** the workpage to make your workspace visible to its members. Without doing this, the workpage is only visible to you.

    <!-- border -->![Publish workspace](27a-publish.png)

    >You can also save as a draft and check your page before you are ready to publish.

  2. In the popup, leave the option checked to **Show in Feed Updates** and then click **Publish**.

    > By leaving the **Show in Feed Updates** checked, all workspace members will be informed of your changes. In the future, if the changes you make to your workspace aren't significant, you can uncheck this option.

    <!-- border -->![Add to feed](27d-add-to-feed.png)

This is how your workspace looks:
