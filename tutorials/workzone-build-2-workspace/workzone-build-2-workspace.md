[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create a workspace)]

Workspaces are the building blocks of SAP Work Zone. You can add pages, content such as widgets, apps, forums and more, and you can invite other members to join.

    >You can also select one of SAP's out-of-the-box templates. In this case, you'll get a professionally designed overview page with widgets including everything you need to get started quickly. You can then customize the content to suit your needs. For this tutorial you won't use a template.

3. Enter this name for your workspace: `Employee Innovation Hackathon`.

    >**Tip:** Always use a name that would help users distinguish your workspace from others.

4. Copy and paste this description for your workspace: `Get together and find the answers to your questions about the hackathon!`

5. Select `Private`.

    >Selecting private makes your workspace available to a specific set of members that you've invited to the workspace. If you later want to make it public so that everyone in the company can see it, click **Edit Workspace Settings** at the top of your screen and change the setting to `Public`.

    Now ask a question in the forum.

3. Go back to your workspace overview page by clicking **Untitled** (temporary name of the overview page) next to the **Forum** page.

    !![Go back to overview page](29-go-to-overview-page.png)

4. Scroll down to your **Actions** widget that you added previously and click **Ask a question**.

    !![Add new question](35-add-a-question.png)

2. Add this question: `What time does the hackathon start?` Then click **Publish** so that members will be able to see your question. You'll get a confirmation message that your question was created.

    !![Add first questions](35-first-question.png)

3. Go back to your workspace by using the breadcrumbs at the top.

    !![Go back to Forums page](35a-go-back.png)

You can see that your question has been added to your overview page as well as to your feed.

!![View question](36-view-questions.png)


[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 10: ](Publish and view your workspace)]

  1. Make sure to **Publish** the design of the page and to make your workspace visible to its members. Without doing this, the page is only visible to you.

    !![Publish workspace](27a-publish.png)

    >You can also save as a draft and check your page before you are ready to publish.

  2. In the popup, leave the option checked to **Show in Feed Updates** and then click **Publish**.

    > By leaving the **Show in Feed Updates** checked, all workspace members will be informed of your changes. In the future, if the changes you make to your workspace aren't significant, you can uncheck this option.

    !![Add to feed](27d-add-to-feed.png)

This is how your workspace looks - note the overview page name that you defined is now visible:
