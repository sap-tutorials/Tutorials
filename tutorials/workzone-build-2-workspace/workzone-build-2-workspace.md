# Add a Workspace to SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition
<!-- description --> Create a workspace and add content to it that you can share with other members of your workspace.

## Prerequisites
You have an environment set up and you can access your SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition
&nbsp;
>**SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition is not available in a trial account.**

## You will learn
  - How to create a new workspace
  - How to add content to it and design the layout

## Intro
In this tutorial, you're going to create a workspace where employees who joined the company hackathon challenge, can interact with other members of the workspace, ask questions, and find out all that they need to know.



### Download images for your workspace


Before you start, download these image files so that they're on your computer ready for you to add to your workpage for the workspace that you will create.

- [`workspace_row2_image1.jpg`](Workspace_Images/workspace_row2_image1.jpg)
- [`workspace_row2_image2.jpg`](Workspace_Images/workspace_row2_image2.jpg)
- [`workspace_header_image.jpg`](Workspace_Images/workspace_header_image.jpg)
- [`workspace_image_with_icon1.png`](Workspace_Images/workspace_image_with_icon1.png)
- [`workspace_image_with_icon2.png`](Workspace_Images/workspace_image_with_icon2.png)
- [`workspace_image_with_icon3.png`](Workspace_Images/workspace_image_with_icon3.png)
- [`workspace_image_with_icon4.png`](Workspace_Images/workspace_image_with_icon4.png)



### Create a workspace


Workspaces are the building blocks of SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition. You can add all kinds of content to it and you can invite other users to join as members.

1. In your site, click **Workspaces** in the top-level menu, and then click **New Workspace**.

    <!-- border -->![Create workspace](1-create-new-workspace.png)

2. Select **No Template** from the dropdown list of available templates.

    <!-- border -->![Select template](2-select-template.png)

    >You can also select one of SAP's out-of-the-box templates. In this case, you'll get a professionally designed workpage with widgets including everything you need to get started quickly. You can then customize the content to suit your needs. For this tutorial you won't use a template.

3. Enter this name for your workspace: `Employee Innovation Hackathon`. In workshops, use: `<your unique identifier>_Employee Innovation Hackathon`.

    >**Tip:** Always use a name that would help users distinguish your workspace from others.



4. Copy and paste this description for your workspace: `Get together and find the answers to your questions about the hackathon!`

5. Select `Private`.

    >Selecting private makes your workspace available to a specific set of members that you've invited to the workspace. If you later want to make it public so that everyone in the company can see it, click **Edit Workspace Settings** at the top of your screen and change the setting to `Public`.

6. Click **Create**.

    <!-- border -->![New workspace settings](3-new-workspace-settings.png)

Your workspace is created.



### Configure your workspace notifications


When you create your workspace, you may be prompted to define the frequency of email notifications.

1. Select **Daily** to get any updates to the workspace every day.

2. Click **Accept** to ensure that you've joined the workspace.

  <!-- border -->![Define workspace settings](3a-created-workspace.png)

You can now start building your workspace.

<!-- border -->![Start building a workspace](3c-start-building.png)

Now, let's add content to the workspace.


### Change the image in the workspace header


When you create a new workspace, the header has a dark and light blue background. You can replace this background with your own.

1. Hover over the background in the workspace header to expose the  **Edit cover photo** button and select **Upload Photo**.

    <!-- border -->![New cover photo](4-new-header-image.png)

2. Browse for the following image that you downloaded: `workspace_header-image`.

3. Reposition your photo to display it as you want, and then click **Save**.

    <!-- border -->![Save cover image](5-save-cover-image.png)





### Create a workpage for your workspace


In this step, you'll add a workpage to your workspace - this workpage will describe the purpose of the workspace and will feature relevant content.

1. Click **+** to add a page tab.

    | Caption Layout        |All images: Overlay
    | Background Opacity    |All images: 0%

18. Under **Padding Top**, add the value `30` pixels and click **Save**.

    <!-- border -->![Edit row pixels](22b-edit-pixels.png)


### Design the third section of your workspace


In this step, you'll add an **Action** widget, a **Forum** widget, and a **Feed** widget.

1. Click **+** at the bottom of the second section to add another section.

    <!-- border -->![Add the third row](22a-add-third-row.png)

2. Click **Add Widget**.

3. Select the **Action** widget.

    >Adding an **Action** widget enables workspace members to choose from a selection of commonly used action types. In this tutorial, we want the workspace members to ask questions or add ideas.

    <!-- border -->![Add an action widget](23-add-action-widget.png)

4. Enter the **Widget Title**: `Add your Hackathon Questions & Ideas`.

5. Uncheck all options except for **Ask a Question** and **Add an Idea**. Click **Save** to add the widget to your workpage.

    <!-- border -->![Design actions widget](24-design-actions-widget.png)

    Now let's create the **Forum** widget.

6. Click the **+** next to the widget you just created to add another column.

    <!-- border -->![Add another column](25-add-another-column.png)

7. Click **Add Widget**.

    <!-- border -->![Add a widget to 2nd column](25a-add-widget.png)

8. Select the **Forum** widget.

    > Adding a **Forum** widget enables a workspace member to view questions, ideas, and discussions submitted by their workspace members.

    <!-- border -->![Add a forum widget](26-add-forum-widget.png)

9. Under **Maximum Items to Display**, move the slider to number **2**, change the title to `Ask Questions About the Hackathon`, and click **Save**.

    > On the workpage, only 2 of the questions, ideas or discussions from the forum will be displayed.  

    <!-- border -->![Design the forum widget](27-design-forum-widget.png)


    Now let's add the **Feed** widget.

10.  Add another section.

    <!-- border -->![Add another section](27-add-another-widget.png)

11. Click **Add Widget**

      <!-- border -->![Add another section](27a-add-widget.png)

12. Select the **Feed** widget and keep the default setting to show all events in the feed.  Click **Save**.

    You've now added all three widgets.

13. To increase the spacing between this section and the section above, hover over the section to expose the settings on the right, and click the cog icon to edit the spacing.

    <!-- border -->![Edit row settings](28-edit-row-settings.png)

14. Under **Padding Top**, add the value `30`pixels and click **Save**.

15. Now **Publish** the workpage to make it visible to members of the workspace. Without doing this, the workpage is only visible to you.

    <!-- border -->![Publish](28-publish.png)

16. In the popup, leave the **Show in Feed Updates** selected and click **Publish**.

    <!-- border -->![Publish again](28a-publish-again.png)

    > By leaving the **Show in Feed Updates** checked, all workspace members will be informed of your changes. In the future, if the changes you make to your workspace aren't significant, you can uncheck this option.


### Add a forums tab and ask a question


Apart from the **Forum** widget, you're going to add a dedicated **Forum** page tab. From this page, workspace members can see all the questions, ideas and discussions in the forums that have been created for the workspace.

1. Click the **+** icon.

    <!-- border -->![Add new page tab](28-add-new-page.png)

2.  In the **Add New Page** screen, under the **Content** category, select **Forums** to add the **Forums**  page tab to your workspace. The forum page tab opens a screen displaying all the different forum topics.

    In the next steps, we ask a question in the forum.

3. Go back to your workpage by clicking the **About the Hackathon** workpage.

    <!-- border -->![Go back to overview page](29-go-to-overview-page.png)

4. Scroll down to your **Actions** widget that you added previously and click **Ask a question**.

    <!-- border -->![Add new question](35-add-a-question.png)

2. Add this question: `What time does the hackathon start?` Then click **Publish** so that members will be able to see your question. You'll get a confirmation message that your question was created.

    <!-- border -->![Add first questions](35-first-question.png)

3. Go back to your workspace by using the breadcrumbs at the top.

    <!-- border -->![Go back to Forums page](35a-go-back.png)

You can see that your question has been added to your workpage as well as to your feed.
