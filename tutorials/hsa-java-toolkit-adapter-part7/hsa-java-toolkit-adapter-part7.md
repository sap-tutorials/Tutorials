### Enable Guaranteed delivery

This is done in the custom transporter module. SAP documentation regarding the process can be found in section [Enabling Guaranteed Delivery for an Input Transporter](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_esp_51sp10_adapt/5.1.10/en-US/e7/924c076f0f10149b76975e225dfdf7/frameset.htm).

### Implement Schema Discovery

  1. Add the following two commands to your `.cnxml` file:
    ```html
    <Internal id="x_unixCmdDisc"
      label="Discovery Command"
      type="string"
      default="&quot;$STREAMING_HOME/adapters/framework/bin/discover.sh&quot;
      &quot;$STREAMING_HOME/adapters/framework/instances/mqtt_input/adapter_config.xml&quot;"/>
    <Internal id="x_winCmdDisc"
      label="Discovery Command"
      type="string"
      default="&quot;%STREAMING_HOME%/adapters/framework/bin/discover.bat&quot;
      &quot;%STREAMING_HOME%/adapters/framework/instances/mqtt_input/adapter_con fig.xml&quot;"/>
    ```

  2. Implement sampling or non-sampling schema discovery in your custom transporter module. Consult section [Implementing Schema Discovery in a Custom Adapter](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_esp_51sp11_bca/5.1.11/en-US/e7/8a48b56f0f10149134ab152de88342/frameset.htm) for more details.

### Create an Output Adapter

If you have followed this tutorial to create an input adapter, only minor changes will have to be applied to convert it into an output adapter.

  1. `EspConnector`

      - You will need to choose either [`EspSubscriber`](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b5a4b8b1574f48a383f7a1e42e63d4d9/1.0.12/en-US/e789cecb6f0f1014bdc7ccdcbde12dd6.html?q=espsubscriber) or [`EspMultiStreamSubscriber`](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_esp_51sp11_bca/5.1.11/en-US/e7/855da66f0f1014a43ad7ab965faf16/frameset.htm) instead of the `EspPublisher` we have used.

      -  To make this change, edit the `<Module type="espconnector">` element of your `.cnxml` file. Specifically, specify the chosen `EspSubscriber` in the `<InstanceName>` element

  2. `Formatter module`

      The convert(`AdapterRow in`) method will need to be edited to convert Streaming Analytics objects to `Strings`. You can change it to something along the lines of the following:

      ```java
      Object obj = in.getData(0);
      in.setData(0, obj.toString());
      return in;
      ```

  3. `Transporter module`

      Instead of the following in execute():

      ```java
      AdapterRow row = utility.createRow(msg);
      utility.sendRow(row);
      ```

      You will need something along the lines of the following:

      ```java
      AepRecord record = (AepRecord)row.getData(0);
      if(record != null) {
          String value = record.getValues().toString();
          myDataSink.send(value);
      }
      ```

      Where `myDataSink` is the object you are outputting your data to.

  4. `Mqtt_input.cnxml`

      - Particularly the type attribute for the Adapter element should be changed to **"output"**

        ```html
        <Adapter type="output" â€¦>
        ```

      - You may consider `find > replace all` from input to output. This will require changing the `mqtt_input` folder name in **`%STREAMING_HOME%/adapters/framework/instances/mqtt_input`**

      - Consider changing the name of this file to `mqtt_output.cnxml`

  5. `Adapter_config.xml`, `modulesdefine.xml`, `parametersdefine.xsd`

      You may consider changing "Input" to "Output" in names

      - `<MQTTInputTransporterParameters>`

      - `<Name>MQTT Input</Name>`

  6. `Mqtt.ccl`

      This project assumes the adapter is an input adapter, you will need to make a new project. However, doing so is outside the scope of this tutorial.

### Create Stream Based Transporter and Formatter Modules

  1. Transporter

     Change Execute() function according to following:

     - For input stream based transporters:

        - Create a `ByteBuffer` object and load data into it by calling `<ByteBuffer>.put<Type>(data)`

        - Call `utility.sendRowsBuffer()`

     - For output stream based transporters:

        - Call `utility.getRowsBuffer()` which will return a `ByteBuffer` object.

        - Call `ByteBuffer.get<Type>()` to get data from the object.

Full `ByteBuffer` documentation can be found at [`ByteBuffer`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html)

Documentation regarding custom `Transporter` modules can be found in section [Building a Custom Transporter Module](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a29f649d1a0d4b3f88c634250e42af77/5.1.12/en-US/e789b1b56f0f1014a969ccf833602144.html).

  2. Formatter

    - Have your custom formatter class extend `com.sybase.esp.adapter.framework.module.StreamingFormatter`

    - Implement the following functions:

      - The `init()` function.

        Prepare your formatter module to convert between data formats; for example, obtain properties from the adapter configuration file and perform any required initialization tasks.

      - The `start()` function.

        Perform any necessary tasks when the adapter is started.

    - The `execute()` function.

        Here is an example of the execute() function for a formatter that converts row-based data into stream-based:

        ```java

        public void execute() throws Exception {
          OutputStream output = utility.getOutputStream();  while(!utility.isStopRequested())  {
            AdapterRow row = utility.getRow();
            if(row != null) {
              AepRecord record = (AepRecord)row.getData(0);
              String str = record.getValues().toString() + "\n";   output.write(str.getBytes());
            }
          }
        }

        ```

    - For a formatter that converts from stream-based data into row-based, use:

        - `utility.getInputStream()` to obtain the `InputStream`

        - `utility.createRow()` to create the `AdapterRow` objects

        - `utility.sendRow()` to send the rows to the next module specified in the adapter configuration file

    - The `stop()` function

        Perform any necessary tasks when the adapter is stopped.

    - The `destroy()` function.

        Perform clean-up actions for your formatter.


Documentation regarding custom Formatter modules can be found in section [Building a Custom Formatter Module](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b5a4b8b1574f48a383f7a1e42e63d4d9/2.0.00/en-US/e789b6606f0f10149915c3cb6a302153.html?q=custom%20formatter%20module).

See the `$STREAMING_HOME/adapters/framework/examples/src` directory for source code for sample modules

### Pre-Defined Transporter and Formatter Modules

If your transporter or formatter modules don't require very complex implementation, they may already be provided with your Streaming Analytics installation.

You can find a listing of the predefined Formatter modules in section [Formatters Currently Available from SAP](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8280db55429040f8b665db30cf05a88e/2.0.02/en-US/e785c5536f0f10148ce5edaa93952636.html) as well as their location.

You can find a listing of the predefined Transporter modules in section [Transporters Currently Available from SAP](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8280db55429040f8b665db30cf05a88e/2.0.02/en-US/e785c1236f0f1014bd14db27ffcf687b.html) as well as their location.

### Start and Stop an Adapter in Standalone Mode

  1. Comment out the `ATTACH INPUT ADAPTER` statement in the `ccl` code provided in the Appendix of this tutorial. The `ccl` should simply be as follows:

    ```sql

    CREATE INPUT WINDOW InputWindow1 SCHEMA (
      Message string ) PRIMARY KEY ( Message ) KEEP ALL ROWS ;

    ```

  2. Uncomment the `<ProjectName>` and `<StreamName>` elements in `<EspPublisherParameters>`

  3. Start the project in Studio by pressing the deploy button.

    ![Deploy Streaming Project](deploy-project.png)

  4. Start the adapter by running `start.sh` and pass it the full path to your `adapter_config.xml`.

    `%STREAMING_HOME%\adapters\framework\bin\start.bat`
    `%STREAMING_HOME%\adapters\framework\instances\mqtt_input\adapter_config.xml`

  5. The adapter will use the `<EspProject>` element properties set in your `adapter_config.xml` file to connect to the project in studio and will use the `<MQTTInputTransporterParameters>` element properties as arguments.

### Debug a Custom Adapter

There are two main ways to debug custom adapters:

  1. The first is to use the `Eclipse` debugger. Steps for accomplishing this are outlined in this documentation. This debugger can be used to set break points and/or step through code.

  2. The second is to simply use print statements.

     - For adapter run using the `ATTACH` statement

         Use `utility.getAdapterLogger().info(String)` in your custom `Transporter` and `Formatter` modules to log information.

         Streaming Analytics log info can be found using HANA Studio.

         - In the `SAP HANA Administration Console` perspective, double click your `SYSTEM` in the Systems panel

         - Navigate to the `Diagnosis Files` tab.

         - Look for a `.out` file corresponding to the project you are working on. You can open the file for read in HANA Studio by double clicking it.

         - `utility.getAdapterLogger().info()` will log messages to `<working-directory>\ projects\default.mqtt.0\logs\adapterframework.log.`

     - For standalone adapter run without the `ATTACH` statement

        - `utility.getAdapterLogger().info()` can also be used

        - `utility.getAdapterLogger().info()` will log messages to the console in which the adapter start command was issued as well as `%STREAMING_HOME%/adapters/framework/bin/frameworkadapter.log`

        - `System.out.println()` messages will also appear in the console.
