Click on the **Maintain Projects** tile to **launch the application**.

> **NOTE**: the title "**Maintain Projects**" is taken from the **SAP Fiori Launchpad (FLP) configuration** that was done when the SAP Fiori Elements application has been created following this tutorial: [**Develop the SAP Fiori Elements Application for the SAP SuccessFactors Extension**](cap-extend-sfsf-fiori-elements).

![Figure 14 – Launch Application](launch-app.png)

The **List Report page** for the **Project** entity will be loaded:

Now, click on the **Go** button and the **initial test data** (loaded to the HANA database from the CSV files) will be displayed:

![Figure 16 – Initial test data displayed](test-data.png)

And that's it! You have successfully added a **fully working SAP Fiori Elements application** deployed to **SAP BTP's HTML5 Apps Repository** to an **SAP Launchpad Service** site.

You can, now, test it at your will, in the same way you did using the **Fiori Preview** in **step 6** of the tutorial: [**Prepare the SAP SuccessFactors Extension UI with CDS Annotations**](cap-extend-sfsf-ui-annotations).

And this is the **final step** to **Extend SAP SuccessFactors on SAP BTP with CAP**!


### Check your knowledge




### Stretch yourself


**Congratulations**! After having gone through and completed the tutorials in this group you should have successfully **Extended SAP SuccessFactors on SAP BTP with CAP** with a **simple project management application**!

But there's a lot of room for improvement in this solution, so don't miss the opportunity to challenge yourself and go deeper in learning the technologies showcased in this tutorials group by enhancing your application!

Here's a list of suggestions for enhancements:

- Directly assign an SAP SuccessFactors employee to a project as the "Project Owner" adding the corresponding assignment to the employee profile
- Implement a mechanism to remove the assignment from the employee profile whenever he/she is removed from a project team (either by member deletion or replacement). The same would apply to the "Project Owner"
- Implement validations such as: projects must start at least from the current date (not before) and must end after the start date and activities due dates must be within the project's start and end dates
- Implement a mechanism to avoid activities to be added before there's at least one member in the team to assign them
- Implement restrictions such as: users can only view/manage projects that have been created by themselves, only employees who report to the project creator can be assigned as team members, etc.
- And so on, and so forth… the sky's the limit!
