Visibility scenarios allow users to track the performance of end-to-end processes. You can create, edit, delete, and activate a visibility scenario using the **Configure Visibility Scenarios** application. For more information, see [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/viewer/62fd39fa3eae4046b23dba285e84bfd4/Cloud/en-US/df284fd12073454392c5db8913f82d81.html).

In this tutorial, you explore the application, modify a performance indicator, and activate the visibility scenario. You can choose to modify different entities of Configure Visibility Scenarios such as processes, phases, state, attributes and so on.
