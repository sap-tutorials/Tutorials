### Explore the store


The Store offers predefined content for your automation. Packages are categorized by catalog which let you choose between Business Content, Learning Content and SAP Intelligent RPA SDK.

1. Navigate to the store in your SPA Tenant.

<!-- border -->![Navigate Store](01-NavigateStore.png)

**Learning Content** offers learning packages to get started with the Application Development tool. These packages allow you to learn best practices by reusing the most common flows to design your first projects.

**Business Content** provides pre-built automations for concrete business problems.

**SAP Intelligent RPA SDK** provides all the Software Developments Kits that can be acquired from the store.

Select one or more filters on the left to filter the available Store projects by Project Type (for example Live Process and Process Automation), Format Type (for example, Ready to use and Template), Catalog (for example, Business Content), Product (for example, SAP S/4HANA Cloud), Publisher, Line of Business, and Industry.

    <!-- border -->![Test Automation3](24-testAuto3.png)

    Once you are done designing your process, you may release and deploy your project. Please make sure to run the project in attended mode as the automation **Get Processors Details** has a dialog that needs to be closed by the user and may put on hold the rest of the automation if the **OK** button is not clicked.


### Execute the automation in attended mode


Since the automation requires a human intervention, with a popup dialog, the automation has to be executed in **attended mode**. This means that the user must be present for the automation to run.

You will trigger the automation using the project launcher.

>The project launcher allows you to launch your automation in attended mode in two different ways:
- You can launch your automations manually in attended mode from the agent using the Launch manually from the agent section.
- You can configure events to trigger and launch your automations automatically using the Launch automatically by events section.

In this tutorial, you will manually launch your automation from the agent by adding it in the Launch manually from the agent section of the project launcher.

1. Navigate back to the **Application Development** lobby, choose the project.

2. In the **Application Development** overview page, you can see all the artifacts that are part of the project. The project is **Editable** which means you can modify it.

3. Select the **Get Processors Details** automation.

    <!-- border -->![Overview Automation](25-automation.png)

4. In the **Automation Details** panel, select **Info** and uncheck **Can only be started from another automation**.

5. Choose **Save**.

    <!-- border -->![Uncheck](26-uncheck.png)

6. Now go back to the **Application Development** overview page, and select **p** which is the already created **Project Launcher**.

    <!-- border -->![Project Launcher](27-project-launcher.png)

    The project launcher **p** editor opens in the main panel of the Application Development.

7. Select the three automations that are in the **Launch manually from the agent** section and choose the delete icon.

    <!-- border -->![Delete automations](28-delete-automations.png)

    On the **Project Launcher details** information right-hand side panel, you can see the automations available in your project.

    >In order to execute the automation in attended mode you will need to add the automation to the project launcher

7. In the **Project Launcher Details**, drag the automation **Get Processors Details** and drop it in the **Launch manually from the agent** section of the project launcher.

8. Choose **Save**.

    <!-- border -->![Drag automation](29-drag-automation.png)


### Release and deploy the business process project


Now you may release and deploy it in attended mode. You need to select this trigger type since the user needs to click on **OK**.

1. Choose **Release** and again **Release**.

    <!-- border -->![Release](11-Release.png)

2. Now your project is released and you can deploy it. You can choose **Deploy**.

    <!-- border -->![Release](12-Deploy.png)

    >Since this automation has to be executed in attended mode, you need to create a Trigger.

3. Select **Create a Trigger** and then **Next**.

    <!-- border -->![Deploy Project](13-deploy-project.png)

4. Select **Attended** as a trigger type and **Next**.

    <!-- border -->![Trigger type](14-trigger-type.png)

5. Enter the configuration details and choose **Next**.

    <!-- border -->![Configure trigger](15-configure-trigger.png)

6. You may add an attribute, choose **Confirm** and then **Deploy**.

    <!-- border -->![Advanced Settings](16-advanced-settings.png)

    To Deploy will take a couple of seconds/minutes depending upon how big your project is and how many different skills it has. Any errors during the deployment will be shown in the Design Console.

7. The project deployed successfully and is now ready to be executed.

    <!-- border -->![Deployed Project](17-deployed-project.png)

    > You cannot edit released or deployed projects. To continue working on your project, you need to select the Editable option from the list of released versions.


### Set the agent in attended mode


You need to create a matching agent attribute at this step. Please follow these steps to create an agent attribute in the tenant to add it to your agent and project: [Agent Management Settings to Execute the Process with an Automation](spa-run-agent-settings)

1. Go to your System Tray and choose **Projects**.

    <!-- border -->![Projects](18-systray-projects.png)

2. Set the agent in attended mode.

    Now your project is ready to be launched in attended mode.

    <!-- border -->![Start Project](19-start-project.png)


### Run the business process


1. Navigate back to the **Application Development** overview page and select the **Order Processing** process.

    >Make sure you select the deployed version of the project.

    <!-- border -->![Order 7991](22-order-processing.png)

7. Go back to your Desktop Agent, choose your project and **Start**.

    <!-- border -->![Start Project](19-start-project.png)

8. Now choose **Get Processors Details**.

    <!-- border -->![Get Processors Details](20-get-processors-details.png)

9. In the dialog popup window, enter **order 7991** as Order Reference.

    <!-- border -->![Order 7991](21-order.png)

    The process has successfully ended.
