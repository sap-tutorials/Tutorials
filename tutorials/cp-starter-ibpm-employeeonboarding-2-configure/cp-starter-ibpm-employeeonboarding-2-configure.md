# Configure Business Rules, Workflow and Process Visibility
<!-- description --> Configure workflow, business rules and process visibility to automate processes and decisions, and achieve operational insights into employee onboarding process

## You will learn
  - How to import and manage rules using Business Rules
  - How to import, build and deploy a sample workflow from SAP Business Application Studio
  - How to create and activate a visibility scenario using Process Visibility

## Intro
**Workflow** helps to digitalize workflows and quickly orchestrate tasks that span people, applications, and organizations. You can enhance productivity by automating and tracking coordinated, account-able tasks â€“ including approvals, order fulfillment, or time-sensitive partner collaboration.

**Business Rules** enables business users and application developers to automate their decisions and enhance their decision-making experience. It offers a simplified Fiori-based rule authoring tool and a central rule repository with various deployment options to different platforms.

**Process Visibility** provides visibility into processes that run in the cloud, on-premise, or in hybrid environments. Process visibility works on events. SAP or non-SAP applications (cloud or on-premise) push events into Process Visibility. These events are persisted, processed and enhanced to form end-to-end process instances with insights, which are visualized by business users in their process workspace. The insights enable business users to identify process bottlenecks, track process performance, and operational issues and act on them.

In this section, you will set up business rules to identify the list of equipment to be provisioned for the newly hired employee based on their role and work location using **Business Rules capability of SAP Workflow Management**.

### Configure API Business Hub destination


The sample business rule used in this scenario is published in API Business Hub. `BUSINESSRULES_APIHUB` destination is used in Manage Rule Projects  application to import business rules from API Business Hub. This destination is already created in the previous set up tutorial, and now you will configure the destination for the password.

1. From your global account page, choose the `trial` tile to access your subaccount.

    <!-- border -->![Enter Trial Subaccount](entertrialaccount_1.png)

2. Click **Connectivity | Destinations** from the left-hand navigation and search for the destination with name `BUSINESSRULES_APIHUB`

    <!-- border -->![Create Destination](createdestination-apihub.png)

3. In **Destination Configuration** section, click **Edit** and enter your cloud platform trial user password:

    > Ensure that the user whose credentials (username and password) are entered in the destination **does not have Two Factor Authentication enabled**.

    <!-- border -->![Create Destination](savedestination-apihub.png)

    - **Save** the destination.


### Configure system in business rules


To import the business rules project from API Business Hub, you need to configure a system which points to the API Hub destination and then use this system to import the project.

1. In your web browser, open the Workflow Management application and click the **Manage Rule Projects** tile..

    >You got the workflow management application link in the last step of the set up tutorial. The link would be like:  

    > `https://<subdomain>.cockpit.workflowmanagement.cfapps.<eu10 or us10>.hana.ondemand.com/cp.portal/site#Shell-home`

    <!-- border -->![Rule Editor](ruleeditor.png)

2. Open **Configure Systems**.

3. Click **+** to add a system.

    <!-- border -->![Create System](CreateSystem.png)

4. Enter the following details:

    |  Field Name     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Name           | `APIHub`
    |  Destination    | `BUSINESSRULES_APIHUB` or the name of the destination you created in the set up tutorial

5. **Save** the system configuration.

    <!-- border -->![Create System](CreateSystem_2.png)



### Import business rules from API Business Hub


1. Click **Design** icon, click **Import** to select **Import Project from API Business Hub**.

    <!-- border -->![Import Business Rules](ImportAPIHub.png)

    > If you do not have 2-Factor-Authentication enabled and still get this error, then check if you are member of SAP API Business Hub. Log in to api.sap.com and try importing again.

3. You will see the business rules project imported and in **Active** status.
