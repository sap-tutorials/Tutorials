### Enlarging a Dbspace File Using Reserved Space

When you are ready to use the reserve space you may do it in increments rather than using all of the reserved space at once. Thus, you can enlarge the `Dbspace` file only by what you need.

Navigate to **Manage Dynamic Tiering `Dbspaces`** on your Cockpit. Click on the "**`ES_USER_FILE1`**" created in the last tutorial.

![View ES_USER_FILE1](view_es_file.png)

This will open a detail panel for the `**ES_USER_FILE1** Dbspace` file. To edit this individual `Dbspace` file, click on the "**Edit**" button in the bottom right corner of the page.

You can now increase the `Dbspace` File Size by adding volume from the **Reserved Size**. To increase the size, enter the amount you wish to take from the Reserved Size in the Increase Size field. For this lesson we will use `10MB` of the available `25MB` of Reserved Size.

After entering in "10" in the **Increase Size** field, click **Save** in the bottom right of the window to complete the operation.

Once the save completes, the updated `Dbspace` File details for the `ES_USER_FILE1 dbspace` file will show that the `Dbspace` file size has increased from `100MB` to `110MB` while the Reserved Size has decreased from `25MB` to `15MB`.

### Enlarging Dbspace File through HANA Studio SQL Console

In HANA Studio through the System Database, you may also enlarge a file via the SQL command:

```sql
ALTER EXTENDED STORAGE ALTER DBSPACE ES_USER ALTER FILE "ES_USER_FILE1" ADD 10 MB;
```
