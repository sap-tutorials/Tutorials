[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Install OpenSSL)]

1.  For Windows download [OpenSSL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openssl/files/latest/download).

2.  Extract the downloaded ZIP archive.

3.  For ease of use, we recommend that you add the directories from the OpenSSL binaries to your PATH environment variable. For example, you could enter the following in your terminal (only valid for one session):

    `set PATH=%PATH%;c:\<PATH_TO_OPENSSL.EXE>`

    `set PATH=%PATH%;c:\OpenSSL-Win32\bin\`

    >On macOS, OpenSSL is usually installed by default (`/user/bin/openssl`).
