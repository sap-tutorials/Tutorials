[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Ingest IoT data)]

In this tutorial we will create the Good Receipt for one device and a Quality Control notification for the other.
To permit the creation of a Good Receipt we will send data for one of the two Things (e.g. `Fridge002`) always below the threshold you have set with the **Derivation Rule**, and we will send data for the other (e.g. `Fridge001`) over the threshold value to be able to test also the Quality Check scenario.

1.   Open the **Thing Modeler** application and check the Thing you are sending data below the threshold set in the **Derivation Rule** (e.g. `Fridge002`) has no value for the `threshold` parameter. If not you need to **Delete** the Thing, and recreate the it as in the step 5 of the tutorial [Create Things and Devices for Measured Goods and EPCIS scanner](iot-smartsensing-devices-things-create)

    !![Fridge2Thing](Fridge2Thing.png)

2.   Open MQTT.fx to start sending some data for `Fridge001` and `Fridge002`.

    For example use the following setup for `Fridge001` as described in the step 6 of the tutorial [Create Things and Devices for Measured Goods and EPCIS scanner](iot-smartsensing-devices-things-create)

    -   Topic: `measures/fridge_001`
    -   Payload:

    ```JSON
    {
        "capabilityAlternateId": "temperature",
        "sensorAlternateId": "fridgeThermometer",
        "measures": [{
            "temperature": "21"
          }]
    }
    ```

    Sample for `Fridge002`:

    -   Topic: `measures/fridge_002`
    -   Payload:

    ```JSON
    {
        "capabilityAlternateId": "temperature",
        "sensorAlternateId": "fridgeThermometer",
        "measures": [{
            "temperature": "0"
          }]
    }
    ```

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Adjust EPCIS XML)]

This is an example of an EPCIS event in XML format for the configuration used in this tutorial for `Fridge001`:

```XML[10]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<epcis:EPCISDocument xmlns:epcis="urn:epcglobal:epcis:xsd:1" xmlns:example="http://ns.example.com/epcis" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" creationDate="2005-07-11T11:30:47.0Z" schemaVersion="1.2">
   <EPCISBody>
      <EventList>
         <ObjectEvent>
        <recordTime>2021-01-21T20:35:31.116-06:00</recordTime>
            <eventTime>2021-01-21T20:35:31.116-06:00</eventTime>
            <eventTimeZoneOffset>-06:00</eventTimeZoneOffset>
            <epcList>
               <epc>urn:epc:id:sscc:0614141.1234567890</epc>
            </epcList>
            <action>OBSERVE</action>
            <disposition>urn:epcglobal:cbv:disp:in_process</disposition>
            <readPoint>
               <id>Reader_01</id>
            </readPoint>
         </ObjectEvent>
      </EventList>
   </EPCISBody>
</epcis:EPCISDocument>
```

Copy this XML snippet to an editor of your choice as have to adjust line 10 to your needs. Create two copies of it the one with the `EpcIdUri` you have specified for the Handling Unit connected to `Fridge001` and the other with the value specified to for the Handling Unit connected to `Fridge002`, copied in the step 5.5 and assigned in the step 5.6 of the tutorial [Create Things and Devices for Measured Goods and EPCIS scanner](iot-smartsensing-devices-things-create)

For `Fridge002` it became:

```XML[10]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<epcis:EPCISDocument xmlns:epcis="urn:epcglobal:epcis:xsd:1" xmlns:example="http://ns.example.com/epcis" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" creationDate="2005-07-11T11:30:47.0Z" schemaVersion="1.2">

            <eventTime>2021-01-21T20:35:31.116-06:00</eventTime>
            <eventTimeZoneOffset>-06:00</eventTimeZoneOffset>

            </readPoint>
         </ObjectEvent>
      </EventList>
   </EPCISBody>
</epcis:EPCISDocument>
```

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Ingest EPCIS event via MQTT)]
Escape both XML snippets (e.g. using a JSON String Escape tool) and copy it into the value of `eventxml` in the MQTT JSON Payload. The result will look similar to the two JSON examples below.

Publish the following payload to the `measures/<SCANNER_ALTERNATE_ID>` (replace `<SCANNER_ALTERNATE_ID>` with the alternate id of the scanner e.g. `measures/epcis_scanner`) to create a scanning event for `Fridge001`. It will trigger the processing of a check for existing violations in the threshold parameter and, finally it will create a Goods Receipt in the **S/4HANA Cloud** or a Quality Check notification:

```JSON
{
	"capabilityAlternateId": "epcis_data",
	"sensorAlternateId": "epcis_sensor",
	"measures": [{
		"eventxml": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <epcis:EPCISDocument xmlns:epcis=\"urn:epcglobal:epcis:xsd:1\" xmlns:example=\"http://ns.example.com/epcis\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" creationDate=\"2005-07-11T11:30:47.0Z\" schemaVersion=\"1.2\"> <EPCISBody> <EventList> <ObjectEvent> <recordTime>2021-01-21T20:35:31.116-06:00</recordTime> <eventTime>2021-01-21T20:35:31.116-06:00</eventTime> <eventTimeZoneOffset>-06:00</eventTimeZoneOffset> <epcList> <epc>urn:epc:id:sscc:0614141.1234567890</epc> </epcList> <action>OBSERVE</action> <disposition>urn:epcglobal:cbv:disp:in_process</disposition> <readPoint> <id>Reader_01</id> </readPoint> </ObjectEvent> </EventList> </EPCISBody> </epcis:EPCISDocument>"
	}]
}
```

For the Thing `Fridge002` described in this tutorial it became:

```JSON
{
  "capabilityAlternateId": "epcis_data",
  "sensorAlternateId": "epcis_sensor",
  "measures": [{
    "eventxml": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <epcis:EPCISDocument xmlns:epcis=\"urn:epcglobal:epcis:xsd:1\" xmlns:example=\"http://ns.example.com/epcis\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" creationDate=\"2005-07-11T11:30:47.0Z\" schemaVersion=\"1.2\"> <EPCISBody> <EventList> <ObjectEvent> <recordTime>2021-01-21T20:35:31.116-06:00</recordTime> <eventTime>2021-01-21T20:35:31.116-06:00</eventTime> <eventTimeZoneOffset>-06:00</eventTimeZoneOffset> <epcList> <epc>urn:epc:id:sscc:0614141.1234567800</epc> </epcList> <action>OBSERVE</action> <disposition>urn:epcglobal:cbv:disp:in_process</disposition> <readPoint> <id>Reader_01</id> </readPoint> </ObjectEvent> </EventList> </EPCISBody> </epcis:EPCISDocument>"
  }]
}
```

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Check creation of Quality Control notification)]
After the Handling Unit linked to the Thing `Fridge001` is scanned and the EPCIS event is ingested, the users involved for the `In-App` or `Email` notification will be informed.

For the `In-App Notification` a notification will be generated in the Fiori Launchpad, in the following format:

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Check creation of a Goods Receipt in SAP S/4HANA Cloud)]

Open the Fiori launchpad of your SAP Internet of Things tenant and navigate to the **Thing Engineer OData**, open the app **Thing Modeler** and select again the your package (e.g.: `sap.tutorial`).

1.   Switch to the Thing list and select the Thing that should have generated the **Goods Receipt** (e.g. `Fridge002`).

2.   Switch the tab **Calculated Values** and copy the value of the property **`deliveryDocument`**.

    !![deliveryDocument](deliveryDocument.png)

3.   Go to the Fiori launchpad of your SAP S/4HANA or SAP S/4HANA Cloud system and navigate to the **Inbound Delivery Processing** tab, open the app **Display Inbound Delivery**:

    !![inboundDelivery](inboundDelivery.png)

4.   Search for the Inbound Delivery using the value of the `deliveryDocument` you have copied from the Thing in SAP Internet of Things and press **Continue**.
