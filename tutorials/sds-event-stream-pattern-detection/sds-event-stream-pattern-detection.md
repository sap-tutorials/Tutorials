# Watch for Patterns of Event Streams and Generate Alerts
<!-- description --> Add a pattern matching operator to watch for patterns of events in live event streams. When the pattern is detected, generate an alert.

## Prerequisites
 - **Tutorials:** [Using the Streaming Playback tool to Test a Streaming Project](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/sds-event-stream-playback.html)

## Next Steps
 - **Tutorials:** [Build Custom Flex Operators to Analyze Event Streams](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/sds-custom-flex-operators.html)

## You will learn  
- How to use the CCL Pattern Matching operator to detect specific patterns of events
- How to define the alert event that will be generated whenever the pattern is detected

---
In this example you are going to use the CCL Pattern Matching operator to watch for a power outage on any machine that lasts for more than 20 seconds.  The machines only send simple **"Power off"** and **"Power On"** events.  So you'll use the pattern matching operator to watch for a **"Power off"** event that is not followed by a **"Power on"** event for the same machine within 20 seconds.

### Open your project in the CCL editor


In this tutorial you are going to work in the CCL editor. While you can create a Pattern Matching stream from the visual editor, it's a bit tedious and we're guessing at this point you're probably more likely to just want to see the CCL.

If your project is open in the visual editor, then use the **Switch to Text** function or press **F6** to switch to the CCL editor.

If prompted to save, choose **Yes**.

> If your project wasn't open in any editor at this point, then you can simply double-click on the `.ccl` file in the project folder (in the **Project Explorer** view) to open it in the CCL editor.


### Add the pattern matching stream to your project


Scroll down to the bottom of the CCL file and paste in the following:

```sql

/**@SIMPLEQUERY=PATTERN*/
CREATE OUTPUT STREAM ALARM_POWER
AS SELECT
  A.MACHINEID MACHINEID ,
  A.EVENT_TIME EVENT_TIME ,
  A.LOCATION LOCATION ,
  'POWER' ALARM_TYPE ,
  'POWER Out for more than 20 seconds' ALARM_DESC
 FROM DEVICE_EVENTS A, DEVICE_EVENTS B
 MATCHING [ 20 SEC : A , ! B ]
 ON A.MACHINEID = B.MACHINEID
   AND 	A.EVENT_VALUE = 'Power off'
   AND B.EVENT_VALUE = 'Power on' ;
```

Now let's take a look at the CCL above to understand it:

- There's nothing unusual about the SELECT clause:  you're simply defining the structure and content of the events that will be output by this stream whenever the pattern is detected.
> Note that the alias assigned in the FROM clause is used to reference the input event.

- In this particular example, we are watching for a pattern of events on a single stream. To do this, you list the input stream multiple times in the FROM clause, assigning multiple aliases (one for each event in the pattern).
- The MATCHING clause defines the pattern of events we are watching for, which always starts with a time interval. Every pattern must have a finite time boundary -- in this example, we are watching for an "A" event that is not followed by a "B" event within 20 seconds. The **","** means "followed by". You can also use "AND" or "OR".
- The ON clause is used to qualify what incoming events qualify as an A event or a B event.  Events that don't qualify as an event in the pattern will be ignored. In this example,  any "Power off" event will qualify as an "A" event, and any "Power on" event will qualify as a "B" event. However, since we are watching for the **absence** of a "Power on" event,  then in this example, if you get a "B" event with the same MACHINEID as an "A" event, within 20 seconds of the "A" event, then the "A" event will be dropped.

See the [Streaming Analytics CCL Reference guide](https://help.sap.com/viewer/608c361a786e4ec485224c890cbf1617/2.0.03/en-US/e7965d0d6f0f10149842b86fff8f915b.html) for more information on using the MATCHING clause.


### Compile and check for errors


Click the **Compile Streaming Project (F7)** button to check for errors.

If you want to see this new operator in action, then run the playback tool to stream in the simulated data file again (see the previous tutorial for details).
