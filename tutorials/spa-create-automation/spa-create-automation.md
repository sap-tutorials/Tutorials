### Create the Automation

In this exercise, you will automate the process to read the *sales order* details from an Excel and select the specific sales order details based on the input from the submitted form. To design your automation, you will need an Excel file filled with the sales orders data. You have the possibility to create it yourself using the following data:

| Order Number| Order Amount | Order Date | Shipping Country         | Expected Delivery Date | Order Status
|  :----------| :------------|:-----------| :------------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------

### Create Environment Variable


Business projects usually need to use parameters and variable at runtime. These variables are usually saved in their runtime landscapes for example Dev, Test or Production environments. In this case, you will need to maintain an environment variable that will contain the file full path of the Excel file used in the automation.

> Environment Variables allow you to reuse certain information for a given environment. You use environment variables to pass parameters to automations.

1. Select **Settings**.

    ![001](005.png)

2. In the Project Properties window, select **Environment Variables**, then **+ Create**.

    ![001](006.png)

### Add Excel Activities


You will now design the automation in the Automation Editor by dragging-and-dropping activities into the workflow of the automation. Later you will configure the inputs and outputs of each activity. You will need activities to interact with Microsoft Excel application. These activities will open Excel application, open the workbook that contains the sales orders details and map them into a data type that will be created during the design. Last, after extracting and mapping the data, the Excel application will be closed.

1. Select 3 dots next to **Get Order Details**, choose **Open Editor**, which navigates to the Design Studio to build the automation.

    ![001](009.png)

    > Since Excel is used in this automation, you have to open an Excel instance. Open Excel Instance is a mandatory activity to use when using Excel. Once you open an Excel instance, you can use other Excel activities.

2.  To open the **Excel Instance**:
    -  In the Automation Details section on the right, search for the **Open Excel Instance** activity,
    -  **Drag and drop** the activity into the canvas.

    ![001](010.png)

    > Next, Excel Data Mapping is done with the Excel Cloud Link activity. Excel Data Mapping allows you to transform columns-based data from an Excel sheet into data that can be used in the automation. The data from the Excel sheet stays the same but the structure becomes a data type structure, making it possible to use throughout your project.

3. To get the **Excel Cloud Link**:

    -  in the Automation Details search for the activity **Excel Cloud Link**,
    -  Drag and drop the activity into the canvas,

    ![001](011.png)

    - select **Browse**,
    - choose the **SalesOrdersDetails.xlsx** file which is saved on your machine.

    ![001](013.png)

    > The Excel file is mapped automatically.

6.  In the Workbook Path field enter the Environment Variable as `OrderFilePath`, which was created above as the parameter value for **Workbook path**.

    ![001](014.png)

7. Select the button **From Excel Data**.

    ![001](015.png)

    > A pop up appears to create a data type. A **Sales Order** variable is needed to collect the data from the Excel sheet columns. In this step, a variable is automatically created from the Excel file columns.

8. Under Name of the data type **Sales Order** and choose the **Create** button.

2. Select **Create Sales Order variable**. Under Output Parameters enter the value of as `selectedOrderDetails`.

    <!-- border -->![001](027.png)


### Looping through Excel Sheet and searching for the Order


Now you will loop through each **Order** from the Excel sheet, retrieve the order details for order number submitted in the **Order Processing Form**. **For Each** control allows you to go through a list of members provided as input to your automation, and execute an action for each member in that list.

This control has the following loop parameters:

  - `currentMember` - The member of the list for the current loop iteration.
  - `index` - An integer that is the index of the current loop iteration, starts at 0.

1. To loop through each order:
    - Click on the canvas,
    - In Automation Details search for the control **For Each**,
    - Drag and Drop the activity into the canvas.
