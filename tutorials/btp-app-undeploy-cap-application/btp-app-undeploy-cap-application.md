[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Undeploy your Multi-Target Application (MTA))]
[OPTION BEGIN [Delete applications]]

To undeploy (delete) an `mtar`, you don't need to delete the apps and the services individually. The deploy service on Cloud Foundry keeps track on the deployed `mtar` and its resources.

You can either undeploy the applications or undeploy the applications and their service instances. Undeploying the applications and their service instances will also delete the data stored in these instances (for example, database content).

```Shell/Bash
cf undeploy cpapp
```


[OPTION END]
[OPTION BEGIN [Delete applications and service instances]]

To undeploy (delete) an `mtar`, you don't need to delete the apps and the services individually. The deploy service on Cloud Foundry keeps track on the deployed `mtar` and its resources.

> Deletes all data stored in the application.

```Shell/Bash
cf undeploy cpapp --delete-service-keys --delete-services
