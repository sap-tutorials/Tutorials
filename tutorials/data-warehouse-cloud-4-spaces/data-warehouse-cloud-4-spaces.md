[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Understand your Space)]

In the **Space Management** screen, each Space is represented by a tile. The Spaces tiles can show a red, green, or blue colour table.

•	Green spaces are performing optimally.

•	Red spaces are overactive and need more resources allocated to perform optimally.

•	Blue spaces are under active.

Some resources that aren't being used by a blue space could be reallocated to a red space, for example. You also have the option to monitor a space and see detailed information about disk use and in memory usage. This is done by clicking on the three dots next to your space name.

To see an overview of your space settings, simply select the Space, and this takes you to the overview, where you can monitor your space and see a more detailed view of the same. You can fine tune your disk-space and memory allocations as per your requirements if you wish. For this example, use the minimum configuration.
