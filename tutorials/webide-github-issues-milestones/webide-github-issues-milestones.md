### Fill in issue details


Enter the details about the change required.

In this instance, you will create 2 issues, one issue to remove **Ordered by** label from the Purchase Order header and the other issue to add a **Product ID** column to the Order Details table.

Click **Labels** and set it as **Enhancement**. Labels can be used to categorize issues into bug/enhancements. You can make your own custom labels.
