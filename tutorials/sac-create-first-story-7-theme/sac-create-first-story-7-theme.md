### Apply a Theme and Adjust Styling Options


In Preferences, you can apply default page properties such as page background to both responsive and canvas pages. Furthermore, you can customize the font, color, and color palettes of story tiles such as charts, tables, shapes, input controls, and others.

**1.**	To apply a theme, select **Preferences** under the File tab in the Tool bar

![Theme](Theme 1.png)

> Customizing your own themes and styling is useful when creating stories that adhere to your company's design standard.

Let's apply a custom color palette to our story that is based on our corporate colors.

**2.** Go to **Charts/Geo** under Tile Settings  

**3.** Under Default Color Palettes, select the **Standard** palette  

**4.** Click **+ Create New Palette**  

![Theme 2](Theme 2.png)

**5.** Change the number of swatches from 9 to 6  

**6.** Change each swatch hex color code to the following (from left to right):

    c6c2c2
    9e9ea3
    6b6363
    fc5411
    fc7928
    f9c43e

**7.** Click **Create**

![Create New Palette](Create New Palette.png)

**8.** Select **apply to all pages, lanes, and tiles**  

**9.** Click **OK**

![Theme 4](Theme 4.png)

> This would then apply our imported palette to all the existing pages, lanes, and tiles in the story. On the other hand, applying to new pages, lanes, and tiles would only change the palette of charts we make from here on out.

### Format and Style Items


Let's further customize our story styling by making the top lane black with white text within as well as applying a grey gradient to our left lane.

### Top Lane
**10.** Select the top lane and open the **Styling** tab in the Designer panel  

**11.**	Choose black as the Background color

With a black background, let's make our Numeric Point charts more visible by changing the text white.  

**12.**	Click on a Numeric Point chart and open the **Styling** tab in the Designer panel  

**13.**	Choose white as the Font color

![Make Text White](Make Text White new.gif)

**14.**	Repeat Action 12-13 for the rest of the Numeric Point charts

**19.**	Change the left swatch to `ccccce`  

**20.**	Change the right swatch to `f2f2f2`  

**21.**	Click **Create**

Your dashboard should now look like this:

### Update Titles and Dynamic Texts


Let's create a dynamic text that automatically updates the text based on the source input control or filter.

**23.**	In the **Chart Action Menu** of the textbox, click **+ Add** and select **Dynamic Text**

![Dynamic Text](Dynamic Text 1.png)

**24.**	Select the **Dimensions** tab in the left navigation bar  

**25.**	Click **Region**  

**26.**	Click **Create**

![Dynamic Text](Dynamic Text 2 new.gif)

**27.**	Add "Summary of Sales in" in front of the dynamic text to create a title like this:

**28.**	Update the left lane title to "Page Filters"  

**29.**	Update the "Gross Margin per Date" chart title to "Gross Margin over Time"  

**30.**	Update the "Quantity sold, Sales Revenue per Date" chart title to "Quantity sold, Sales Revenue over Time"

![Update Titles](Update Titles 2.png)

**31.**	In the Sales Manager Overview page, update the left lane title to "Page Filters"  

**32.**	Select **Remove** in the **Chart Action Menu** of the empty text object
