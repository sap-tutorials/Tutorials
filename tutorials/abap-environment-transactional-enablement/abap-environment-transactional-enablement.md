## Prerequisites  
- You need an SAP BTP, ABAP Environment [trial user](abap-environment-trial-onboarding) or a license.
- Business Catalog `SAP_CORE_BC_EXT_TST` assigned to your business user
- Initial development setup

## Details
### You will learn
- How to define a behavior implementation


In this tutorial, wherever `XXX` appears, use a number (e.g.Â `000`).

>For the **unmanaged implementation** type, the application developer must implement essential components of the REST contract manually. For the **managed scenario**, all required standard operations (create, update, delete) must only be specified in the behavior definition to obtain a ready-to-run business object.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Open Eclipse)]
  1. Go to your ABAP package created in [Create and Expose a Core Data Services Based on a Database Table](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-create-cds-view.html) and open your data definition `ZI_BOOKING_XXX` to add following statement:
  `root`.

      ![Open Eclipse](eclipse.png)

      The **root entity** is of particular importance, since it defines the top node in a business object's structure and serves as a representation of the business object.

  2. Save and activate.

      ![Open Eclipse](saveandactivate.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create behavior definition)]
  1. Right-click on your data definition `ZI_BOOKING_XXX` and select **New Behavior Definition**.

      ![Create behavior definition](behaviordef.png)

  2. Provide a description, make sure, that your implementation type is unmanaged and click **Next >**.

      ![Create behavior definition](definition2.png)

  3. Click **Finish** to complete your transport request.

      ![Create behavior definition](definition3.png)

  4. Check result. An empty behavior definition for unmanaged implementation is created.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Implement behavior definition)]
  1. Provide an alias (`booking`) and specify the lock master. Define the table field **`LastChangedAt`** for the `ETag` handling. Replace the following coding:

    ```ABAP
    unmanaged implementation in class z_i_booking_xxx unique;

    define behavior for ZI_Booking_xxx alias booking
    lock master
    etag master LastChangedAt
    {
      create;
      update;
      delete;
    }

    ```
  2. Save and activate.

      ![Implement behavior definition](saveandactivate.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Create behavior implementation)]
  1. Right-click on your behavior definition and select **New Behavior Implementation**.

      ![Create behavior implementation](behavior.png)

  2. Provide the name **`Z_I_BOOKING_XXX`** and a description and click **Next**.

      ![Create behavior implementation](class.png)

  3. Provide a transport request if required and click **Finish**.
