# Create Rule Service and Ruleset
<!-- description --> Create and activate ruleset and rule service artefacts as part of Bonus Plan Percentage Calculation rules project.

## You will learn
  - How to create `rule service` which is the deployable entity of business rules
  - How to create `ruleset` to bundle rules with same output

## Intro
**`Rule Service`** is an interface or an end point that enables an application to invoke a decision logic. In an online transaction or workflow, rule service is invoked by passing any relevant input from an application to the rule service in a stateless manner.

**`Ruleset`** is a logical collection of rules that helps you group business rules that govern a specific function. A `ruleset` links a rule or group of rules to a rule service.
