# Prepare User Authentication and Authorization (XSUAA) Setup
<!-- description --> This tutorial shows you how to set up User Authentication and Authorization (XSUAA).

## Prerequisites
 - [Set Up SAP HANA Cloud for Kyma](btp-app-kyma-hana-cloud-setup)


## You will learn
 - How to set up User Authentication and Authorization (XSUAA)


---

### Setup XSUAA

1. Run the following command in your project folder:

    ```Shell/Bash
    cds add xsuaa --for production
    ```

    What happens here? Running `cds add xsuaa` does two things:

    - Adds the XSUAA service to the `package.json` file of your project
    - Creates the XSUAA security configuration (that is, the file `xs-security.json`) for your project



2. Check if the following lines have been added to the `package.json` in your `cpapp` project:

  <!-- cpes-file package.json:$.cds.requires -->
  ```JSON[7-9]
  {
    ...
    "cds": {
      "requires": {
        "[production]": {
          ...
          "auth": {
            "kind": "xsuaa"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Roles and scopes

A scope represents a single authorization to perform an action. For example, there could be a scope "Read" and a scope "Write". The scope allows a user to read or write a certain business object. Scopes can't be assigned to users directly. They're packaged into roles. For example, there could be a role "Editor" consisting of the "Read" and "Write" scopes, while the role "Viewer" consists only of the "Read" scope.

Check the file `xs-security.json` that was created in your `cpapp` project. The file contains the configuration of the XSUAA (SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service). The CAP server takes the authorization parts `@(restrict ... )` from our service definition form and creates scopes and role templates from it. For example, it found the roles `RiskViewer` and `RiskManager` in the `srv/risk-service.cds` file:

```JavaScript[4,8]
  entity Risks @(restrict : [
            {
                grant : [ 'READ' ],
                to : [ 'RiskViewer' ]
            },
            {
                grant : [ '*' ],
                to : [ 'RiskManager' ]
            }
      ]) as projection on my.Risks;
```

And created scopes and roles for both in the `xs-security.json` file:

```JSON
{
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "$XSAPPNAME.RiskViewer",
      "description": "Risk Viewer"
    },
    {
      "name": "$XSAPPNAME.RiskManager",
      "description": "Risk Manager"
    }
  ],
  "role-templates": [
    {
      "name": "RiskViewer",
      "description": "Risk Viewer",
      "scope-references": [
        "$XSAPPNAME.RiskViewer"
      ],
      "attribute-references": []
    },
    {
      "name": "RiskManager",
      "description": "Risk Manager",
      "scope-references": [
        "$XSAPPNAME.RiskManager"
      ],
      "attribute-references": []
    }
  ]
}
```
