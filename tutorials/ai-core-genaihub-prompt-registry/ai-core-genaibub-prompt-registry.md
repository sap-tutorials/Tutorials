### Pre-read

In this tutorial, we explore the **Prompt Registry** feature within the **Generative AI Hub**, focusing on how to efficiently manage and utilize prompt templates in orchestration pipelines.

Prompt templates allow for dynamic and structured interactions with AI models. This tutorial will guide you through the end-to-end process of integrating these templates into your orchestration workflows.
A **Prompt Registry** is a centralized system for storing, managing, and versioning prompt templates used in AI-driven applications. It allows developers and teams to reuse, modify, and track changes in prompts efficiently. This is particularly useful in large-scale AI projects where prompts need to be standardized, refined, and deployed across different models or scenarios. 

**Why Use a Prompt Registry?** 

-	**Consistency** – Ensures uniform prompts across different use cases.

-	**Version Control** – Tracks prompt iterations and allows rollback if needed.

-	**Collaboration** – Enables teams to work on prompt engineering collaboratively.

-	**Automation** – Integrates prompts seamlessly into AI workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

There are two key approaches to managing prompts in a **Prompt Registry**:

1.	**Imperative API (Direct API Control for Dynamic Prompt Management)**: The Imperative API allows you to create, update, and manage prompt templates dynamically via API calls. This approach is best suited for interactive design-time use cases, where you need to iteratively refine prompts and track their versions. Each change is explicitly made via CRUD operations, and you can manage versions manually.
2.	**Declarative API (Git-based Sync for Automated Prompt Management)**: The Declarative API, on the other hand, integrates with SAP AI Core applications and is ideal for CI/CD pipelines. Instead of managing templates through direct API interactions, you define them as YAML files in a Git repository. The system automatically syncs these templates, ensuring that updates are seamlessly reflected in the prompt registry without manual intervention.

**You will learn:**

- Declarative approach to creating a prompt template. 
- How to **register and sync** a prompt template in Generative AI Hub.
- How to **consume the registered prompt** within an orchestration workflow.
- How to apply **Grounding**, **Data Masking**, and **Content Filtering** to improve the quality, safety, and relevance of AI-generated responses.

For more information on prompt registry, refer to the official documentation:  
[Prompt Registry in SAP Generative AI Hub – Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/prompt-registry?version=CLOUD)

### Create a Prompt Template (Declarative)  

[OPTION BEGIN [AI Launchpad]]

- The declarative approach allows you to manage prompt templates using Git repositories, ensuring automatic synchronization with the Prompt Registry. Instead of making API calls to create and update templates manually, you define them in YAML files, commit them to Git, and let the system handle synchronization. 

- Create a prompt template and push it to your git repository.  The file must be named in the following format: **your-template-name**.prompttemplate.ai.sap.yaml

- YAML File Structure: Copy the below code

```YAML

name: multi_task
version: 1.1.1
scenario: multi-task-processing
spec:
  template:
    - role: "system"
      content: "{{ ?instruction }}"
    - role: "user"
      content: "Take {{ ?user_input }} from here"
  defaults:
    instruction: "default instruction"
    user_input: "default user input"
  additionalFields:
    isDev: true
    validations:
      required: true
    blockedModels:
      - name: "gpt-4"
        versions: "gpt-4-vision"
      - name: "gpt-4o"
        versions: "*"
 
```
![img](img/image001.png)

**Note** - The defaults and additionalFields fields are optional.  The additionalFields field is unstructured and can be used to store metadata or configuration objects. Refer to the screenshot above for reference. 

- Once the YAML file is created and pushed to Git, the system automatically syncs it with the Prompt Registry. 

[OPTION END]
