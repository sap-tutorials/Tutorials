[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Set up SAP Business Application Studio)]
You create your workspace where you will later build the workflow.

1. In your web browser, open the [SAP BTP Trial cockpit](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/cockpit).

2. Choose **SAP Business Application Studio**.

3. In the application studio, choose **Create Dev Space**.

5. Click the **Dev Space** to access the workspace.

    > It takes 2-3 minutes to initialize your dev workspace for the first time. You will see a Welcome page once the dev space is initialized.

6. If you have never accessed the workspace before, choose **File** | **Open Workspace**.

7. Select the **projects** folder, and choose **Open**.

    ![See Projects Folder](see-result-projects-folder.png)

    > The **PROJECTS** explorer is opened.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create an MTA project)]
You need to create a multitarget application (MTA) project that contains a workflow module.

1. Open **File** | **New Project from Template**.

2. Choose **Basic Multitarget Application**, and then choose **Start**.

    ![Select Basic MTA](select-basic-mta2.png)

3. Enter a project name, for example, `onboarding`, and choose **Finish**.

    The IDE opens again with MTA as a workspace. It contains an `mta.yaml` file, which describes the application.

    ![See YAML File](new-yaml2.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Create a workflow module and a workflow)]
You now need to create a workflow module within the MTA project.

1. Right-click the `mta.yaml` file, and then choose **Create MTA Module from Template**.

2. Choose **Workflow Module**, and then choose **Start**.

    ![Select Workflow Module](select-wf-module.png)

3. Enter a path to the location where the module is to be generated. We recommend using the proposed one.

4. Enter a name for the workflow module, for example, `approvals`, then choose **Next**.

5. Enter a name for the workflow, for example, `onboard`, and a description, then choose **Finish**.

    ![See Simple Onboard Workflow](see-onboardwf.png)

The workflow module together with a workflow is created and opens.
