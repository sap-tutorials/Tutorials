<!-- description --> Explore select functionality available in SAP HANA Spatial Services  including geocoding, mapping and routing.

## Prerequisites
  - Access to an SAP Business Technology Platform account with the ability to add the SAP HANA Spatial Service
  - A tool such as the REST Client extension for Visual Studio Code enabling the calling of a REST API
  - A development tool such as Visual Studio Code or the SAP Business Application Studio to create Python and Node.js applications

## You will learn
  - How to subscribe to the SAP HANA Spatial Service in the SAP Business Technology Platform
  - How to use the REST API for geocoding, mapping, and routing services
  - How to call these services from a sample program

## Intro
[SAP HANA Spatial Services](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_SPATIAL_SERVICES) provide a unified interface to spatial services that support various back-end service providers such as Here and `Esri`.  These services can be accessed through a REST API and provide support for geocoding, routing, and mapping.  Details of these REST APIs can also be found in the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/search?searchterm=sap%20hana%20spatial%20services&tab=All&refinedBy=true&top=12).

![HSS in the SAP API Business Hub](API-business-hub2.png)

> The video [Access HANA Spatial Services APIs Using Visual Studio Code](https://sapvideoa35699dc5.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_1gh36cjc) provides a demonstration of accessing the three APIs.

### Setup
Full details on the setup can be found at [SAP HANA Spatial Services Onboarding Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_SPATIAL_SERVICES/4e2337c5371a4ac18195cfe751514735/dd6f736b34664a7996b0792cd1f690bb.html).  The following is a brief summary of the required steps.

1. Regions where SAP HANA Spatial Services are available can be found in the [SAP Discovery Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-hana-spatial-services?service_plan=lite&region=all&commercialModel=cpea&tab=service_plan).

    ![service availability](discovery-center.png)

2. After creating a subaccount in one of the regions that offers the SAP HANA Spatial Services, add the entitlement.

    ![add the entitlement](add-service-plan.png)

    >Additional details on adding entitlements can be found at [Add a New Entitlement to Your Subaccount](cp-cf-entitlements-add).

3. Create a service instance.  

    ![create the service](create-service.png)

4. Add a service key to the service which provides the URL and credentials to access the service.

    ![add a service key](add-service-key.png)

    >When creating a service key, a JSON file or parameters section is not needed and can be left empty.

### Get started with the REST Client extension for Visual Studio Code

There are multiple tools that enable making calls to a REST API such as Postman, browser extensions, libraries in programming languages such as [requests](https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/#rest-and-python-consuming-apis) in Python or [https](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html) in Node.js.  Feel free to use the tool of your choice.  This tutorial will be using the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension for Visual Studio Code.  The following content demonstrates how to make a REST API call in general.

1. If required, download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

2. Create a folder and a text file that will contain REST API calls and open the file with Visual Studio Code.

    ```Shell (Microsoft Windows)
    mkdir %HOMEPATH%\HSSTutorial
    cd %HOMEPATH%\HSSTutorial
    code HSS.http
    ```

3. Paste the following into the opened file and save it.

    ```HTTP
    #Example REST API call
    #From https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5725430/http-test-server-accepting-get-post-requests and
    GET https://httpbin.org/get?firstname=Bob&lastname=Smith

    ###

    #Example REST API call
    #From https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/http-requests-in-node-js.html
    GET https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY

    ###

    #Pet Store
    #From https://petstore.swagger.io/#/pet/findPetsByStatus
    GET https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/findByStatus?status=available

    ###
    ```

    >The # is used as a single line comment character and ### is used to separate REST API calls.

4. Add the REST Client extension from Marketplace after opening the extensions view.

    <!-- border -->![Install Rest client ](REST-client-install.png)

5. Try calling the sample REST APIs by clicking on the blue text `Send Request`.  

    <!-- border -->![send request](send-request.png)

    The results should appear in another pane.  An example result is shown below.

    ![sample RESP API Call](sample-REST-call.png)

    Notice that the URL includes the URL parameters `firstname` and `lastname`.  The first parameter is indicated with a `?`, while the subsequent parameters are indicated by an `&`.


### Request a bearer token to enable access to the REST APIs

The following steps are required to create a bearer token that will be used in subsequent steps that make REST API calls.  The bearer token is generated by a login request and can be understood as "give access to the bearer of this token".  Additional details can be found at [User Account and Authorization Service](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/75.7.0/index.html#token) for Cloud Foundry.

1. In the SAP BTP Cockpit, navigate to the previously created SAP HANA Spatial Services instance and select the service key.

    ![Access the service key](access-service-key.png)

2. View the created service key.  The next step will require the `uri`, `uaa.url`, `clientid`, and `clientsecret` values.

    ![Examine the service key](view-service-key.png)

3. Replace the contents of HSS.http file with the contents below.  Highlighted values are to be updated with details from your service key.

    ```HTTP[4, 8, 11, 14 ]
    #REST Client variables -------------------

    #From the uri, last field in the service key
    @uri =
    @oauth = oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials

    #From the uaa.url field.
    @uaa_url =

    #From the clientid field.  
    @clientid =

    #From the clientsecret field.  
    @clientsecret =

    #Generated by the request bearer token call.  Copy the access_token value from the result without the quotes
    @bearer =

    #Authorization REST API call --------------------

    #Request Bearer Token
    GET {{uaa_url}}/{{oauth}}
    Authorization: Basic {{clientid}}:{{clientsecret}}

    ###
    ```

4. Execute the Request Bearer Token call using the Send Request link.  Copy the returned `access_token` value to the **bearer** variable on line 17 of the file HSS.http.

    ![start of the access_token to be Copied](access_token.png)


### Geocoding

The following instructions will demonstrate how to provide one or more addresses and generate longitude and latitude values for each address.  Further details are available at [Geocoding API v1](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_SPATIAL_SERVICES/c7837a0d78e24fb5b9f66a058ab9f730/d2309e6309584d6db7b23ba4cacd9af1.html).

1. Add the following to the bottom of HSS.http.

    ```HTTP
    #Geocoding example
    POST {{uri}}/geocoding/v1/geocode
    Authorization: Bearer {{bearer}}
    content-type: application/json

    {
        "credentials": {
            "provider": "Here",
            "api_key": "SAP-KEY"
        },
        "addresses": [
            "445 Wes Graham Way, Waterloo",
            "Seagram Drive, Waterloo"
        ]
    }

    ###
    ```

2. Send the request to use the Here provider to geocode the provided address for the SAP Waterloo Labs office.

    ![Result of request to geocode](geocode-rest.png)

    A returned value can be verified by entering it into Google Maps as shown below.

    ![verifying the result](geocode-result-on-a-map.png)

3. An example of making the REST API call in a Python program is shown below.

    Install the requests module and create and edit a Python file.

    ```Shell
    pip install requests
    code geocode.py
    ```

     Copy the below code into geocode.py.  Highlighted values are to be updated with details from your service key.  Sensitive values could alternatively be read from environment variables.

    ```Python[6, 7, 9]
    #Import your dependencies
    import requests, os, json

    #request a bearer token
    #update uri, oauth_url, and auth values to match values from your service key
    uri = ""
    oauth_url = "" + "/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials"
    #Fill in clientID and clientsecret values below
    auth = ("","")
    #A better practice is to access credential values from environment variables
    #auth = os.environ.get('clientid'), os.environ.get('clientsecret'))
    response = requests.post(oauth_url, auth=auth)

    bearer_token = json.loads(response.text)
    #print('Auth token: ', bearer_token)

    #call the geocode REST API
    request_headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'content-type': 'application/json',
        'authorization': 'Bearer '+ bearer_token.get('access_token')
    }

    json_data = { "credentials": {
            "provider": "Here",
            "api_key": "SAP-KEY"
        },
        "addresses": [
            "445 Wes Graham Way, Waterloo",
            "Seagram Drive, Waterloo"
        ]}

    response = requests.post(uri + "/geocoding/v1/geocode", headers=request_headers, json=json_data)
    geocode_result = json.loads(response.text)
    print(json.dumps(geocode_result, indent=2))
    ```

    ```Shell
    python geocode.py
    ```

    ![calling geocode API from Python](python-geocode.png)

### Routing

The following instructions will demonstrate how to take two addresses and generate a set of directions between the two addresses.  Further details are available at [Routing API v1](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_SPATIAL_SERVICES/c7837a0d78e24fb5b9f66a058ab9f730/b42fac7d6e3e4d12a32bf4e0b2d262e9.html).

1. Add the following to the bottom of `HSS.http`.

    ```HTTP
    #Routing example
    #geojson result can be viewed on a map at https://geojson.io/#
    POST {{uri}}/routing/v1/route
    Authorization: Bearer {{bearer}}
    content-type: application/json

    {
      "credentials": {
        "provider": "Here",
        "api_key": "SAP-KEY"
      },
      "waypoints": {
        "type": "MultiPoint",
        "coordinates": [
                [
                    -80.55128,
                    43.48032
                ],
                [
                    -80.53434,
                    43.46942
                ]
          ]
      },
      "vehicleType": "pedestrian"
    }

    ###
    ```

2. Send the request to use the Here provider to get route details between the two provided addresses.  The following is the returned `geojson` response.

    ![Result of request for routing](routing-result.png)

    A few of the returned values are explained below:  

    * `coordinates` is an array of the points that show the route selected.

    * `length` is the distance of the route in meters.

    * `duration` is the time the route will take in seconds.

    In the above example, the route is 2 and 1/2 Kilometers and should take 44 minutes to walk.


3. The returned result can also be shown on a map that accepts `geojson` results as shown below.

    ![route shown on a map](routing-geojson.png)

4. An example of making the REST API call in a Node.js application is shown below.

    Initialize a Node project, install node-fetch and create and edit a JavaScript file.

    ```Shell
    npm init -y
    npm install node-fetch@2
    code route.js
    ```

    Copy the below code into route.js.  Highlighted values are to be updated with details from your service key.  Sensitive values could alternatively be read from environment variables.

    ```JavaScript[3, 4, 6]
    const fetch = require('node-fetch');

    const oauth_url = "" + "/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials";
    const uri = "";
    //Fill in clientID and clientsecret values below
    const auth = "Basic " + Buffer.from("" + ":" + "").toString('base64');
    //const auth = "Basic " + Buffer.from(process.env.clientid + ":" + process.env.clientsecret).toString('base64');
    //Note, on Windows, precede | with ^| in the clientid when setting the environment variable

    const outh_headers = {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Authorization": auth
    }

    var request_headers = {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "authorization": "Bearer "
    }

    const json_data = {
      "credentials": {
        "provider": "Here",
        "api_key": "SAP-KEY"
      },
      "waypoints": {
        "type": "MultiPoint",
        "coordinates": [
          [
            -80.55128,
            43.48032
          ],
          [
            -80.53434,
            43.46942
          ]
        ]
      },
      "vehicleType": "pedestrian"
    }

    //Get the bearer token
    fetch(oauth_url, { method: 'GET', headers: outh_headers })
      .then((res) => {
        return res.json()
      })
      .then((auth_result) => {
        //Add the bearer token to the authorization header
        request_headers.authorization = request_headers.authorization + auth_result.access_token;

        //make a routing request
        fetch(uri + "/routing/v1/route", { method: 'POST', headers: request_headers, body: JSON.stringify(json_data) })
          .then((res) => {
            return res.json()
          })
          .then((routing_result) => {
            console.log(JSON.stringify(routing_result, null, 2));
          });
      });
    ```

    ![routing call from Node.js](routing-nodejs.png)


### Mapping

The following instructions will demonstrate how to use the mapping service to return a map tile.  Further details are available at [Mapping API 1.0](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_SPATIAL_SERVICES/c7837a0d78e24fb5b9f66a058ab9f730/becaeffd263f41228081c3ec2c726101.html).

1. Add the following to the bottom of `HSS.http`.

    ```HTTP
    #Mapping examples
    GET {{uri}}/mapping/v1/here/tiles/maptile/newest/normal.day/4/8/5/256/png
    Authorization: Bearer {{bearer}}

    ###

    GET {{uri}}/mapping/v1/here/tiles/maptile/newest/normal.day/4/4/6/512/png
    Authorization: Bearer {{bearer}}

    ###
    ```

    The parameters used in this example are explained below:  

    * `provider` in this example is Here.

    * `zoom/column/row` these values are further explained at [Here Map Tile](https://developer.here.com/documentation/map-tile/dev_guide/topics/request-constructing.html) documentation.

    * `size` is the pixel size of the map tile such as 256 or 512.

2. Send the requests to use the Here provider to return map tiles.

    ![Mapping result](mapping-result.png)

3. A mapping control such as the [SAP Fiori GeoMap](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/api/sap.ui.vbm.GeoMap%23overview) can be used to display multiple map tiles and provide items on the map.  The video [Using the SAP HANA Spatial Services Mapping API in a Fiori App](https://sapvideoa35699dc5.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_ra527yhr) provides a demonstration of this.


### Knowledge check    


Congratulations! You have now used the HANA Spatial Services to perform geocoding, routing, and mapping.  Upcoming features can be seen on the [SAP Road Map Explorer](https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?range=CURRENT-LAST&PRODUCT=73555000100800001421#Q4%202022).
