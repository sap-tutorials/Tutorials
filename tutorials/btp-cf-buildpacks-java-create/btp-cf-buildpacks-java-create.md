# Create a Java Application via Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface
<!-- description --> Create a simple Java application in the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) and enable services for it.

## Prerequisites
 - You have a productive account for SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). If you don't have such yet, you can create one so you can [try out services for free] (https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-free-tier-account.html)
 - You have created a subaccount and a space on Cloud Foundry Environment
 - [cf CLI] (https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/4ef907afb1254e8286882a2bdef0edf4.html) is installed locally
 - You have downloaded [`JDK for SapMachine 11`] (https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/) and [installed] (https://github.com/SAP/SapMachine/wiki/Installation) it locally, configuring your `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables
 - You have [Apache Maven] (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) downloaded. To do that, go to **Files** and choose the `Binary zip archive` link. For this tutorial, we use version `3.8.5`
 - [Install Maven] (https://maven.apache.org/install.html) - similar to JDK, configure your `PATH` and `MAVEN_HOME` variables
 - You have downloaded and installed [Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers] (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)


## You will learn
  - How to create a simple "Hello World" application in Java
  - How to run authentication checks via XSUAA service
  - How to run authorization checks by setting XSUAA scopes


## Intro
This tutorial will guide you through creating and setting up a simple Node.js application by using cf CLI. You will start by building and deploying a web application that returns simple data – a **Hello World!** message, and then invoking this app through another one - a web microservice (application router).

---

### Log on to SAP BTP


First, you need to connect to the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment with your productive subaccount. Your Cloud Foundry URL depends on the region where the API endpoint belongs to. To find out which one is yours, see:  [Regions and API Endpoints Available for the CF Environment] (https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/f344a57233d34199b2123b9620d0bb41.html?version=Cloud)

In this tutorial, we use `eu20.hana.ondemand.com` as an example.

1. Open a command-line console.

2. Set the Cloud Foundry API endpoint for your subaccount. Execute (using your actual region URL):

    ```Bash/Shell
    cf api https://api.cf.eu20.hana.ondemand.com
    ```
3. Log in to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment:

    ```Bash/Shell
    cf login
    ```

4. When prompted, enter your user credentials – the email and password you have used to register your productive SAP BTP account.

> **IMPORTANT**: If the authentication fails, even though you've entered correct credentials, try [logging in via single sign-on] (https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/e1009b4aa486462a8951c4d499ce6d4c.html?version=Cloud).

#### RESULT

Details about your personal SAP BTP subaccount are displayed (API endpoint, user, organization, space).




### Create a Java Project


Before creating an application, you need a Java project. For this tutorial, you can easily create one by using Spring Boot.

1. Open: `https://start.spring.io`

2. From the configuration screen, choose `Maven Project`, language `Java`, and Spring Boot version `2.7.0 `.

3. From `Project Metadata` section, you need to do the following settings:

    - **Group**: `com.example`

    - **Artifact**: `java-tutorial`

    - **Name**: `HelloWorld`

    - **Description**: `A simple HelloWorld Java project`

    - **Package name**: `com.example.java-tutorial`

    - **Packaging**: `Jar`

    - **Java**: `8`

4. Choose `Add Dependencies` and then select `Spring Web`.

5. Choose `Generate`.

6. A `java-tutorial.zip` file is generated. Save it on your local file system and then extract the `java-tutorial` folder.



#### RESULT

You have successfully created a basic Java project.






### Complete your Java Project


For this part, you need to configure your `HelloWorld` application, add an extra class, and a `manifest.yml`  file.

1. Open `java-tutorial` directory in a console client, and execute:

    ```Bash/Shell
    mvn install
    ```

    This command builds your Java project (as a Maven one).

2. Go back to the `java-tutorial` folder and create a file `manifest.yml` with the following content (using your ACTUALL path!):

    ```YAML
    ---
    applications:
    - name: helloworld
      random-route: true
      path: ./target/java-tutorial-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
      memory: 1024M
      buildpack: sap_java_buildpack
      env:
        TARGET_RUNTIME: tomcat
        JBP_CONFIG_COMPONENTS: "jres: ['com.sap.xs.java.buildpack.jdk.SAPMachineJDK']"
    ```

3. Now open your Eclipse IDE.

4. Choose `File` > `Open Projects from File System`, and browse to your `java-tutorial` folder.

5. Select `Add project to working sets` and choose `Finish`.

    Your `java-tutorial` project is populated in the `Project Explorer`.

6. Navigate to `src\main\java\com\example\javatutorial` and double-click on `HelloWorldApplication.java`.

7. In the `public static void main` class, add the following line: 	`System.out.println("Hello World!");`

    Your final Java code should look like this:

    ```Java

    package com.example.javatutorial;

    import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
    import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

    @SpringBootApplication
    public class HelloWorldApplication {

    	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		SpringApplication.run(HelloWorldApplication.class, args);
    		System.out.println("Hello World!");
    	}

    }
    ```

8. Navigate to `src/main/java` and go to the `com.example.javatutorial` package.

9. From its context menu, choose `New` > `Class`.

10. Enter `MainController` as the name of the Java class and choose `Finish`. The new class appears in the project navigation.

11. Open the `MainController.java` file and replace its default content with the following code:

    ```Java

    package com.example.javatutorial;

    import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
    import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

    @RestController
    @RequestMapping(path = "")

    public class MainController {
       @GetMapping(path = "")
       public ResponseEntity<String> getDroneMedications() {
          return new ResponseEntity<String>("Hello World!", HttpStatus.OK);
       }

    }
    ```

#### RESULT

Your Java project is complete and your application is ready to be deployed.






### Deploy your Java application


You are in the Eclipse IDE.


1. Test your project locally. To do that, right-click on `HelloworldApplication.java` and choose `Run As` > `Java Application`.

    The final result displayed in the `Console` tab should be: **Hello World!**  

    > Same result will be displayed in a browser if you enter: `localhost:8080`

2. Now go to the `java-tutorial` directory and build your project again, by executing:

    ```Bash/Shell
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. Then execute:

    ```Bash/Shell
    cf push
    ```

    This command deploys your Java application.

    > Make sure you always execute `cf push` in the folder where the `manifest.yml` file is located! In this case, that's `java-tutorial`.

4. When the staging and deployment steps are completed, the `helloworld` application should be successfully started and its details displayed in the command console.

5. Now open a browser window and enter the generated URL of the application (see the route).

  For example:  `https://helloworld-1234-noway.cfapps.eu20.hana.ondemand.com`

#### RESULT

Your Java application is successfully deployed and running on the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. A **Hello World!** message is displayed in the browser.





### Run an Authentication Check


Authentication in the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment is provided by the Authorization and Trust Management (XSUAA) service. In this example, OAuth 2.0 is used as the authentication mechanism. The simplest way to add authentication is to use the Node.js `@sap/approuter` package. To do that, a separate Node.js micro-service will be created, acting as an entry point for the application.

1. In the `java-tutorial` folder, create an `xs-security.json` file for your application with the following content:

    ```JSON
    {
      "xsappname" : "helloworld",
      "tenant-mode" : "dedicated"
    }
    ```

2. Create an `xsuaa` service instance named `javauaa` with plan `application`. To do that, execute the following command in the `java-tutorial` directory:

    ```Bash/Shell
    cf create-service xsuaa application javauaa -c xs-security.json
    ```

3. Add the `javauaa` service in `manifest.yml` so the file looks like this:

    ```YAML
    ---
    applications:
    - name: helloworld
      random-route: true
      path: ./target/java-tutorial-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
      memory: 1024M
      buildpack: sap_java_buildpack
      env:
        TARGET_RUNTIME: tomcat
        JBP_CONFIG_COMPONENTS: "jres: ['com.sap.xs.java.buildpack.jdk.SAPMachineJDK']"
      services:
      - javauaa
    ```

    The `javauaa` service instance will be bound to the `helloworld` application during deployment.

4. Now you have to create a microservice (the application router). Go to the `java-tutorial` folder and create a subfolder `web`.

    > **IMPORTANT**: Make sure you don't have another application with the name `web` in your space! If you do, use a different name and adjust the rest of the tutorial according to it.

5. Inside the `web` folder, create a subfolder `resources`. This folder will provide the business application's static resources.

6. Inside the `resources` folder, create an `index.html` file with the following content:

    ```HTML
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>Java Tutorial</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Java Tutorial</h1>
      <a href="/helloworld/">My Application</a>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    This will be the start page of the `helloworld` application.

7. In the `web` directory, execute:

    ```Bash/Shell
    npm init
    ```

    This will walk you through creating a `package.json` file in the `web` folder. Press **Enter** on every step.

8. Now you need to create a directory `web/node_modules/@sap` and install an `approuter` package in it. To do that, in the `web` directory execute:

    ```Bash/Shell
    npm install @sap/approuter --save
    ```

9. In the `web` folder, open the `package.json` file and replace the **scripts** section with the following:

    ```JSON
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node node_modules/@sap/approuter/approuter.js"
    },
    ```

10. Now you need to add the `web` application to your project and bind the XSUAA service instance (`javauaa`) to it. To do that, insert the following content **at the end** of your `manifest.yml` file.


    ```YAML
    - name: web
      random-route: true
      path: web
      memory: 1024M
      env:
        destinations: >
          [
            {
              "name":"helloworld",
              "url":"https://helloworld-1234-noway.cfapps.eu20.hana.ondemand.com/",
              "forwardAuthToken": true
            }
          ]
      services:
      - javauaa
    ```

    > For the `url` parameter, use the generated URL (the `route` value for the `helloworld` application) from the previous step!

11. In the `web` folder, create an `xs-app.json` file with the following content:

    ```JSON
    {
      "routes": [
        {
          "source": "^/helloworld/(.*)$",
          "target": "$1",
          "destination": "helloworld"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    With this configuration, the incoming request is forwarded to the `helloworld` application, configured as a destination. By default, every route requires OAuth authentication, so the requests to this path will require an authenticated user.


12. Open your `pom.xml` file and replace the entire `<dependencies>` block with the following:

    ```XML
    <dependencies>
        <!-- Spring Boot starter packages -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
        </dependency>

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cloud-connectors</artifactId>
            <version>2.2.13.RELEASE</version>
        </dependency>

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>

        <!-- Spring and XSUAA Security -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa</groupId>
            <artifactId>xsuaa-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
            <version>2.12.2</version>
        </dependency>

        <!-- dependencies for test -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```


13. Now go to the `java-tutorial` directory and execute:

    ```Bash/Shell
    mvn clean install
    ```

14. Then execute:

    ```Bash/Shell
    cf push
    ```

    This command will update the `helloworld` application and deploy the `web` application.

    > ### What's going on?

    >As of this point of the tutorial, the URL of the `web` application will be requested instead of the `helloworld` URL. It will then forward the requests to the `helloworld` application.


15. When the staging and deployment steps are completed, the `web` application should be successfully started and its details displayed in the command console.

16. Open a new browser tab or window, and enter the generated URL of the `web` application.

    For example:   `https://web-thankfully-5678.cfapps.eu20.hana.ondemand.com`

17. Enter the credentials for your SAP BTP user.


#### RESULT

- A simple page with title `Java Tutorial` is displayed. When you click the `My Application` link, the output of your `helloworld` application is displayed.

- Check that the `helloworld` application is not directly accessible without authentication. To do that, refresh its previously loaded URL in a web browser – you should get a response `401 Unauthorized`.





### Run an Authorization Check


Authorization in the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment is also provided by the XSUAA service. In the previous example, the `@sap/approuter` package was added to provide a central entry point for the business application and to enable authentication. Now to extend the example, authorization will be added.

1. Navigate to `src/main/java` and go to the `com.example.javatutorial` package.

2. From its context menu, choose `New` > `Class`.

3. Enter `WebSecurityConfig.java` as the name of the Java class and choose `Finish`. The new class appears in the project navigation.

4. Open the `WebSecurityConfig.java` file and replace its content with the following code:

    ```Java
    package com.example.javatutorial;

    import com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa.XsuaaServiceConfiguration;
    import com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa.token.TokenAuthenticationConverter;
    import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
    import org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter;
    import org.springframework.security.authentication.AbstractAuthenticationToken;

    import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;

    import org.springframework.security.config.http.SessionCreationPolicy;
    import org.springframework.security.oauth2.jwt.Jwt;
    import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;

    @Configuration

    public class WebSecurityConfig {

    	@Autowired
    	XsuaaServiceConfiguration xsuaaServiceConfiguration;

    	@Bean
        public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {

            http
            .sessionManagement()
            // session is created by approuter
            .sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)
            .and()
                // demand specific scopes depending on intended request
                .authorizeRequests()

                .antMatchers("/**").authenticated()
                .anyRequest().denyAll() // deny anything not configured above
            .and()
                .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt()
    				.jwtAuthenticationConverter(getJwtAuthoritiesConverter());

            return http.build();
        }

    	/**
    	 * Customizes how GrantedAuthority are derived from a Jwt
    	 *
    	 * @returns jwt converter
    	 */
    	Converter<Jwt, AbstractAuthenticationToken> getJwtAuthoritiesConverter() {
    		TokenAuthenticationConverter converter = new TokenAuthenticationConverter(xsuaaServiceConfiguration);
    		converter.setLocalScopeAsAuthorities(true);
    		return converter;
    	}

    }
    ```

5. In the same way, create another Java class, named `NotAuthorizedException.java`, and replace its content with:

    ```Java
    package com.example.javatutorial;

    import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseStatus;

    @SuppressWarnings("serial")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN)
    public class NotAuthorizedException extends RuntimeException {
        public NotAuthorizedException(String message) {
            super(message);
        }
    }
    ```

6. Open the `MainController.java` file and replace its content with the following:

    ```Java
    package com.example.javatutorial;

    import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
    import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
    import org.springframework.security.core.authority.SimpleGrantedAuthority;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
    import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
    import com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa.token.Token;

    @RestController
    @RequestMapping(path = "")

    public class MainController {

       @GetMapping(path = "")
       public ResponseEntity<String> readAll(@AuthenticationPrincipal Token token) {
           if (!token.getAuthorities().contains(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("Display"))) {
               throw new NotAuthorizedException("This operation requires \"Display\" scope");
           }

           return new ResponseEntity<String>("Hello World!", HttpStatus.OK);
       }
    }
    ```

7. To introduce application roles, open the `xs-security.json` in the `java-tutorial` folder, and add the necessary scope `Display` and role template `Viewer`, as follows:

    ```JSON
    {
        "xsappname": "helloworld",
        "tenant-mode": "dedicated",
        "scopes": [
          {
            "name": "$XSAPPNAME.Display",
            "description": "Display content"
          }
        ],
        "role-templates": [
          {
            "name": "Viewer",
            "description": "View content",
            "scope-references": [
              "$XSAPPNAME.Display"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ```

8. Update the XSUAA service. To do that, in the `java-tutorial` directory execute:

    ```Bash/Shell
    cf update-service javauaa -c xs-security.json
    ```

9. Then build your project, by executing:

    ```Bash/Shell
    mvn clean install
    ```

10. And finally, execute:

    ```Bash/Shell
    cf push helloworld
    ```

    This command will redeploy only the `helloworld` application. No changes have been made in `web` so no need to redeploy it.

11. Try to access `helloworld` again (in a browser) in both ways – directly, and through the `web` application router.


#### RESULT

- If you try to access it directly, a `401 Unauthorized` response is still displayed due to lack of authorization token (expected behavior).

- If you try to access it through the app router, it results in a `403 Forbidden` response due to missing permissions. To get these permissions, you need to create a role collection containing the role `Viewer` and assign this role to your user. You can do this only from the SAP BTP cockpit.




### Assigning Roles to a User in SAP BTP Cockpit


1. Open the SAP BTP cockpit and go to your subaccount.

2. From the left-side menu, navigate to `Security` > `Role Collections`.

3. Create a new role collection. For example, `MyJavaAppRC`.

4. Click this role collection and then choose `Edit`.

5. In the `Roles` tab, click the `Role Name` field.

6. Type **Viewer**. From the displayed results select the `Viewer` role that corresponds to your application, and choose `Add`.

7. Now go to the `Users` tab, and in the `ID` field, enter your e-mail. Then enter the same e-mail in the `E-Mail` field.

8. Save your changes.

    > Your role collection is now assigned to your user and contains the role you need to view the content of your application.

    > Now you need to apply these changes to the `helloworld` application by building and redeploying it again.

9. Go back to the command line, and in the `java-tutorial` directory, execute:

    ```Bash/Shell
    mvn clean install
    ```

10. And finally, execute:

    ```Bash/Shell
    cf push helloworld
    ```

#### RESULT

When you try to access again the `helloworld` application through the app router, it will successfully display the **Hello World!** message.
