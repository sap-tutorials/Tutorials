### Overview of SAP HANA Cloud, data lake


SAP HANA Cloud is composed of multiple components.

  * SAP HANA is an in-memory, multi-model, column-based, relational database. For further details see [Introduction to SAP HANA Cloud](https://help.sap.com/viewer/db19c7071e5f4101837e23f06e576495/latest/en-US/7a27607b08ba46d5b253365e703b1c1a.html) and the tutorial mission [Use Clients to Query an SAP HANA Database](mission.hana-cloud-clients).

  * SAP HANA Cloud, data lake is composed of two components:  data lake Relational Engine and data lake Files.    

    [Data Lake Relational Engine](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_DATA_LAKE/a896c6a184f21015b5bcf4c7a967df07/bedae75d1482413d92af8ca7f43d430b.html) is a disk-based, column-oriented relational database for storing and analyzing high volumes of infrequently updated data. It descends from [SAP IQ](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_IQ/latest/en-US), which was previously named Sybase IQ. Because of its heritage, there are commonalities with other Sybase products. Many client interface drivers are shared with [SAP SQL Anywhere](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_SQL_Anywhere/17.0/en-US) and SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise.

    [Data Lake Files](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_DATA_LAKE/a896c6a184f21015b5bcf4c7a967df07/502642d7fd0e4a5b9b3a61c8ac4d5ce5.html) can be used to store and access unstructured data such as trace files and structured files like CSV, Parquet, or ORC. Structured files can use [SQL on Files](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_DATA_LAKE/a896c6a184f21015b5bcf4c7a967df07/b8ed121f351a4a56a451b9ba6f10f88e.html), which enables SQL queries to be performed on them.  

    >Note, that the data lake Files component is currently not available in free tier or trial accounts.

### Choose where to deploy the database instances

The SAP BTP platform provides multiple runtime environments such as Kyma and Cloud Foundry.  When a HANA Cloud or data lake instance is created, it can be created at the BTP subaccount or in a Cloud Foundry space.  The tools (SAP HANA Cloud Central, SAP HANA cockpit, and SAP HANA database explorer) can be used to provision and manage instances in the BTP subaccount or in a Cloud Foundry space.  In the screenshot below, there is an instance of a data lake that was provisioned in the BTP subaccount (Runtime Environment = Other) and one that was provisioned into Cloud Foundry.

![Runtime Environments](runtime.png)

The new multi-environment tooling (once a subscription and setup is complete) can be accessed under subscriptions.

![multi environment tools](multi-env-tools.png)

The previous version of the tooling can be accessed within a Cloud Foundry space.

![Cloud Foundry tools](cf-tools.png)

Further details on this topic can be found at [SAP HANA Cloud goes multi-environment](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/09/21/sap-hana-cloud-goes-multi-environment-part-1-feature-overview/) and [SAP TechEd DA261 - Multi-Environment SAP HANA Cloud Tools](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2022-DA261/tree/main/exercises/multi-environment/ex1).

### Create a data lake instance

>To complete the tutorials in this group, a SAP HANA Cloud, data lake instance is needed, which is created within the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). There are two different free options available, which are the SAP BTP free-tier and SAP BTP trial.  For instructions on registering, see [Start Using SAP HANA Cloud Free Tier Model or Trial in SAP BTP Cockpit](hana-cloud-mission-trial-1).

The following steps provide instructions on how to create a data lake instance in the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) trial.  Additional content on this topic is available at [Quick Start Tutorial for Data Lake](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_DATA_LAKE/a89a80f984f21015b2b2c84d2498d36d/02710372f294441a9f2c7874763232b6.html).

There are multiple ways to create a data lake:  

* A data lake can be created in step 6 of the SAP HANA Database creation wizard.  

    ![add a data lake](add-data-lake2.png)

* A data lake can be added to an already created SAP HANA database that does not have a data lake already associated with it.  

    ![add data lake](add-data-lake.png)

    When a data lake is created in either of the previous two methods, it is configured to be maximally compatible with an SAP HANA database.  

* A data lake can be created that is independent (standalone) of a SAP HANA database by using the **Create Instance** button and the option **SAP HANA Cloud, data lake**.  

    ![independent data lake](standalone.png)

    ![Standalone data lake](standalone2.png)

    A standalone data lake can be configured with additional options such a collation value of UTF8BIN and blank padding set to ON to be more compatible with an on-premise SAP IQ.

1. Using the SAP BTP Cockpit open SAP HANA Cloud Central using one of the two methods described in the step Choose where to deploy the database instances.

2. If a data lake is not already present, add one using one of the three methods previously described.

    Take note when creating the data lake that the administration user is HDLADMIN.

    >The HDLADMIN user has a [login policy](https://help.sap.com/viewer/745778e524f74bb4af87460cca5e62c4/latest/en-US/a43f448484f21015924f9951e9b77e32.html) that enforces the [update of the password](https://help.sap.com/viewer/745778e524f74bb4af87460cca5e62c4/latest/en-US/a458edd784f2101580a1eca5042678f8.html) after 180 days.  

3. As this instance is a free tier or trial account, set allowed connections to **Allow all IP addresses** so that client applications can connect from any IP address.  

    ![Allowed connections](allowed-connections.png)

4. After a while, press the **Refresh** button or enable auto-refresh and the status should change from CREATING to RUNNING once the instance has been created.

    ![data lake running](data-lake-running.png)

    >**Important:** SAP HANA Cloud, HANA data lake free tier or trial instances are shut down overnight and will need to be restarted before working with them the next day.


### Open the SAP HANA cockpit


1. Once the data lake has been created, use the actions menu (three dots) to open SAP HANA cockpit.  

    ![Open in cockpit](open-cockpit.png)

    Input your credentials. These are stored by the SAP HANA cockpit and are shared with the SAP HANA database explorer in cockpit connections once entered into the following dialog.

    ![Credentials](credentials.png)

    After you enter your credentials, should you wish to use a different set of credentials, the current credentials can be cleared using **Clear Credentials** and new credentials may be entered.

    ![Credentials](credentials2.png)

2. The SAP HANA Cockpit can also be used to examine and configure users and roles. 


### Create tables, views, functions, and procedures with SAP HANA database explorer

In this step, a sample HOTEL dataset will be created comprising tables, a view, and a stored procedure.

1. In SAP HANA cockpit, select **Open SQL Console** to open the SAP HANA database explorer.

    ![open database explorer](open-dbx.png)

2. Execute a few queries.

    ```SQL
    SELECT CURRENT USER FROM DUMMY;
    SELECT * FROM sa_db_properties() WHERE UPPER(PropName) LIKE '%NAME%';
    SELECT * FROM SYS.SYSOPTIONS WHERE UPPER("option") LIKE '%VERIFY%';
    CALL sa_conn_properties(CONNECTION_PROPERTY('Number'));
    ```

    ![SAP HANA database explorer](dbx-query.png)

    ![Product Features](productfeatures.png)

    Follow the remaining prompts to finish the installation.

4.  The installation location can be referenced through an environment variable.

  * On Microsoft Windows, in a newly opened command prompt run the following to see the installation location.

    ```Shell (Windows)
    ECHO %IQDIR17%
    ```

  * On Linux, this environment variable and others are set in a file named `IQ.sh`.  Configure it to be run each time the Bash shell is started by referencing it in `.bash_profile` or possibly `.bashrc`.

    Open the `.bash_profile`.

    ```Shell (Linux)
    pico ~/.bash_profile
    ```

    >This tutorial uses notepad and `pico` as default text editors, but any text editor will do.
    >`Pico` can be installed on SUSE Linux with

    >```Shell (Linux SUSE)
    sudo zypper install pico
    >```

    Add the following line to point to the location where the SAP data lake client is installed.

    ```Shell (Linux) .bash_profile
    source /path-to-data-lake-install/IQ.sh
    ```

    Test the change by running:

    ```Shell (Linux)
    source ~/.bash_profile
    ```

    The following command should display the install location of the data lake client.

    ```Shell (Linux)
    echo $IQDIR17
    ```

    > In the case that the Data Lake Client needs to be uninstalled, run the `uninstall.exe` file located in the directory `/path-to-data-lake-install/sybuninstall/IQClientSuite/`.


### Connect with the Interactive SQL Client (DBISQL)


The data lake client install includes [Interactive SQL Client (DBISQL)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a895964984f210158925ce02750eb580/latest/en-US/4abee782576b4bff9f1a1274d662f74b.html), which can be used to connect and query a data lake Relational Engine. The following steps will provide instructions on how to connect to the data lake Relational Engine using DBISQL and then populate the previously created tables with sample data.

1. Start the GUI version of DBISQL from the Microsoft Windows Start menu, by browsing to it under SAP > Interactive SQL and double clicking on it, or by entering `dbisql` in a terminal.

    ![start dbisql](dbisql-start-1.png)

2. Specify the connection type.

    ![Connection type](dbisql-connection-type.png)

    >The Connect window may appear enlarged on the screen. This can be adjusted by lowering the Scale and layout value in the device display settings.

3. Provide the connection details. See below on how to obtain the instance ID and landscape values.

    ![instance ID and landscape](connect-to-dl-iq.png)

    >SAP HANA Cloud Central can be used to get the instance ID and landscape value.  The landscape value can be obtained from the SQL Endpoint by removing the instance ID from the start and port number from the end.

    >![copy sql endpoint](dbisql-copy-endpoint.png)
    >
    > A failure to connect could be caused by the allowed connections list, which is editable in SAP HANA Cloud Central.  

    ![DBISQL Connected](dbisql-connected.png)

    >DBISQL can also be started without a GUI.
    >
    >```Shell (Windows)

    Additional details on the SQL used above can be found at [INSERT Statement for Data Lake Relational Engine](https://help.sap.com/viewer/19b3964099384f178ad08f2d348232a9/latest/en-US/a61fdeff84f21015aa66b9add387d7f9.html). Moreover, the [LOAD TABLE Statement for Data Lake Relational Engine](https://help.sap.com/viewer/19b3964099384f178ad08f2d348232a9/latest/en-US/7ca3f60902f3473296cb309533d89210.html) can be used for efficient mass insertion into a database table from a file with ASCII or binary data.

    >Autocommit is set to on in the SQL Console of the database explorer, while in DBISQL it is set to off.  A series of insert statements will run quicker in the SQL Console if they are surrounded with begin and end or if autocommit is set to off.
    >
    ```SQL
    begin
    INSERT INTO HOTEL.ROOM VALUES(11, 'garden view', 13, 190.00);
    INSERT INTO HOTEL.ROOM VALUES(11, 'connecting room', 15, 175.00);
    end;
    ```
    >
    ```SQL
    set temporary option auto_commit= 'off';
    INSERT INTO HOTEL.ROOM VALUES(11, 'triple', 7, 235.00);
    INSERT INTO HOTEL.ROOM VALUES(11, 'quad', 5, 275.00);
    set temporary option auto_commit= 'on';
    ```
    >
    >Autocommit can also be set via the connection settings dialog.

2. Notice that pressing ctrl-space brings up auto complete (GUI mode only).

    ![auto complete](show-reservations.png)

    Query a table, a view, invoke a function, and call a stored procedure.

    ```SQL
    SET SCHEMA HOTEL;
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL;
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL_ROOMS_VIEW;
    SELECT AVERAGE_PRICE('single'), AVERAGE_PRICE('double'), AVERAGE_PRICE('suite') FROM DUMMY;
    CALL SHOW_RESERVATIONS(11, '2020-12-24');
    ```

    ![Query in DBISQL](dbisql-query.png)

3. DBISQL can also execute SQL from the command line or from a provided file. A few examples are shown below.

    ```Shell
    dbisql -c "uid=USER1;pwd=Password1;host=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX.iq.hdl.trial-XXXX.hanacloud.ondemand.com:443;ENC=TLS(tls_type=rsa;direct=yes)" "select * from HOTEL.CUSTOMER;"
    dbisql -c "uid=USER1;pwd=Password1;host=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX.iq.hdl.trial-XXXX.hanacloud.ondemand.com:443;ENC=TLS(tls_type=rsa;direct=yes)" sql.sql
    ```
