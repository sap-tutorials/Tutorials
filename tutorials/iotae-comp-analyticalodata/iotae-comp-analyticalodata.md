[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Get access to trial systems and tools)]

- **Tools**
  Please check [Call IoT Application Enablement service APIs with Postman](iotae-api-postman) to have the Postman tooling ready.
- **SAP API Business Hub**
  New to API Business Hub? Check <https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-abh-getting-started.html> first.
  Please note, that screenshots used in this tutorial are based on the classic design UI of the website: <https://api.sap.com/?ui=oldUI>

For further questions regarding these APIs, please refer to the latest documentation:
<https://help.sap.com/viewer/350cb3262cb8496b9f5e9e8b039b52db/latest/en-US/66d4abe77cb44fd3b8299ce049b54dba.html>

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Access the AE IoT Services API)]

In this example, we are using data from the enviroCar database [https://envirocar.org](https://envirocar.org).

![Image](pic5.png)

The database contains real-life car data in order to investigate the impact driving has on environmental factors, such as fuel consumption, CO2, or noise emissions. The data is anonymised, meaning it is not possible to connect it to a specific driver. Data available via the enviroCar API can be used by third parties in accordance with the Open Database License (`ODbL`).
We do not use the enviroCar service directly but a copy and we have further anonymised cars and car types in order to not advertise certain brands.

We will use a part of this data for three cars and a subset of measurements. The three cars will be represented in the package `enviroCar` of our trial system.

We would like to know, which car had the highest fuel consumption for a given set of tracks. We will obtain the data by using the aggregates function.

In order to verify the thing model, please go to the SAP API Business Hub and search for the API by clicking on **Browse**:

![Browse](pic6.png)

Enter **`IOTAE`** in the search field and press **Enter**.

![Search](pic7.png)

The results list will provide the API Package `SAP Internet of Things (IoT) Application Enablement services`.

Click the package to navigate to the following page:

![Navigate to API](pic8.png)

Choose the tab **Artifacts** to see the three endpoints to access Configuration, Thing and Thing Analytics. We will have a look at all of them one at a time.

![Artifacts](pic9.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Verify configuration)]

In this step, we will have a look at the configuration service to explore the contents of the package used in this example. We will see the thing types and property set types that we can get while accessing this package. The configuration is similar to a definition of objects and its properties.

Click **Configuration** to check the package  `enviroCar`. In the following screen, click  **Get** for `Configuration {id}`.

 ![Click Get](pic10.png)

Scroll down to the editable field for `id` and enter `sap.iotaehandson2.envirocar`.

![Enter ID](pic11.png)

Click **Try it out!** to make the request.

![Try it out](pic12.png)

The response should look like this, showing the package configuration for `envirocar` with a thing type called `cartype` and a property set type `Measurements`.

 ![Response](pic13.png)

This is one way to obtain the configuration. You can use a REST client or a similar method to get the same result.

Copy the URL
```http
https://sandbox.api.sap.com:443/iotae/conf/Configuration(%27sap.iotaehandson2.envirocar%27)
```
and paste it into a REST client like Postman.

 ![Paste URL](pic15.png)

Obtain the API key from the upper right corner.

 ![API key](pic14.png)

Your API key will show up instead of the gray box. Copy the key to your clipboard.

![Copy key](pic16.png)

Add the header `apikey` with your key.

![Add key header](pic17.png)

Click **Send** to retrieve the following response:

![Send](pic19.png)

For the following steps, you can use the SAP API Business Hub page to send the request.

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Verify things)]

Go back to SAP API Business Hub page to select `things` instead of `configuration`. Click `get` for `/things`.

![Select things](pic20.png)

>In case you try this service without a filter, different things from other packages might show up that you do not expect. Please use the following filter to obtain the things as used in this example.

In the edit field for `$filter`, add the following filter for the thing type:

```http
_thingType eq 'sap.iotaehandson2.envirocar:CarType'
```

![Filter](pic21.png)

Click **Try it out!**. This will result in the following response.

You could have chosen the following URL directly:

```http
https://sandbox.api.sap.com:443/iotae/mds/Things?%24filter=_thingType%20eq%20%27sap.iotaehandson2.envirocar%3ACarType%27
```

The result shows 4 cars that were taken out as examples from the `enviroCar` database.

![4 cars](pic22.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Access Thing Analytics)]

Now access the SAP API Business Hub and chose Thing Analytics'. We will verify time series data first.

![Thing Analytics](pic23.png)

Click **GET** for `/{propertySetTypeName}/measurements`.

Set the following:

  - `propertySetTypeName`:
    ```http
    sap.iotaehandson2.envirocar:Measurements
    ```
  - `$filter`:
    ```http
    time ge datetime'2018-01-01T00:00:00' and time lt datetime'2018-03-01T00:00:00'
    ```

These are a mandatory parameters for the request.

![Parameters](pic24.png)

The response will look like this:

![Response](pic25.png)

The response contains single measurements that were obtained from a car and sent to the `enviroCar` database. Each single measurement contains the car ID (corresponds to the thing name), a timestamp and a list of different measurements for speed, temperature, fuel consumption, CO2 and more.

The list of measurements looks like this:

```json

        "path": "Measurements"
      }
```

To combine single measurements to a trip, a dedicated `Track` is added to the measurement (not during driving but later in the database).

Now open the chapter **Time Series Aggregates** and click **GET** for `/{propertySetTypeName}/aggregates`.

![Time series aggregates](pic26.png)

Set the following:

  - `propertySetTypeName`:
    ```http
    sap.iotaehandson2.envirocar:Measurements
    ```
  - `$filter`:
    ```http
    time ge datetime'2018-01-01T00:00:00' and time lt datetime'2018-03-01T00:00:00'
    ```

These are a mandatory parameters for the request.

![Parameters](pic27.png)

Click **Try it out!** to obtain the following response:

![Response](pic28.png)

For each property, a list of characteristics is calculated and displayed (like for `CO2`):

```json
"CO2_MIN": "1.163272",
"CO2_MAX": "46.601913",
"CO2_AVG": "11.82093400057939",
"CO2_SUM": "69542.55472540855",
"CO2_COUNT": "5883",
"CO2_STDDEV": "8.721946886525672",
"CO2_FIRST": "14.333569",
"CO2_LAST": "1.735356",
"CO2_TFIRST": "/Date(1514541690000)/",
"CO2_TLAST": "/Date(1515651627000)/",
"CO2_TMIN": "/Date(1515159505000)/",
"CO2_TMAX": "/Date(1515563111000)/",
```

It is possible to filter for a specific car (or thing). Set the following:

  - `propertySetTypeName`:
    ```http
    sap.iotaehandson2.envirocar:Measurements
    ```
  - `$filter`:
    ```http
    id eq 'B66347EB30EF46D8BFCD6361532000A5' and time ge datetime'2018-01-01T00:00:00' and time lt datetime'2018-03-01T00:00:00'
    ```

This will provide the results for a single car only.

The result will look like this:

```json

Compared to the example in Step 5, the aggregates are calculated based on a further dimension: the track number. This was possible as the property set `Measurements2` contained a different setting for property `Track`. In `Measurements2`, it was marked as a dimension.

So you see that you can slice and dice the data by using Analytical OData services. If you compare the data for all obtained results, you will find that the highest consumption average occurred in the last track `5a5709d844ea85087e6841de` as the average speed was the highest, too.

In case that you want to know which car or thing was used in the track, please add `id` at the beginning of the select list.
