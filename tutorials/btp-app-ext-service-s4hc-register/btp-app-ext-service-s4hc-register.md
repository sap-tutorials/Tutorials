### Set up entitlements for your SAP BTP subaccount

After you have connected the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system to SAP BTP (with status **Enabled** in your SAP S/4HANA Cloud tenant), you need to configure entitlements to make this system accessible in the SAP BTP subaccount in which you want to build your extension application. You configure the entitlements and assign the corresponding quota and service plans to the subaccount in which the extension application will reside.

1. Enter your **Global Account**.

2. Choose **Entitlements** &rarr; **Entity Assignments**.

      <!-- border -->![Entity Assignments](entity_assignments.png)

5. Choose **Configure Entitlements** &rarr; **Add Service Plans**.

      <!-- border -->![s4h9](s4h9.png)

6. In the **Subaccount `<your-subaccount-name>` Entitlements** dialog box, select the service **SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensibility**.

7. In the **Service Details: SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensibility** screen area, select your newly registered system name from the dropdown help to list the **Available Plans**.

      - **messaging** – to consume SAP S/4HANA Cloud events and create event-based extensions using the event bus from SAP Event Mesh Integration

      - **api-access** – for generic access for SAP S/4HANA Cloud APIs

8. Select both service plans.

9. Choose **Add 2 Service Plans** to add these entitlements for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensibility service for your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system registered to your subaccount.
