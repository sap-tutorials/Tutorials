## Prerequisites
 - [Subscribe to SAP Process Automation using Booster in SAP BTP Free Tier](spa-subscribe-booster)
 - Complete [Create a Business Process](spa-create-process)

## Details
### You will learn
  - How to add interactive forms in the process.
  - How to design the form with layout and input fields using drag-and-drop approach.
  - How to configure the forms as the process steps.


Tasks are vital part of any business process. **SAP Process Automation** helps you to easily and quickly create forms that are made available to the business users in their inboxes to take relevant action. Forms have one layout, once access point, traceable actions and are designed to involve right kind of stakeholders.  

These interactive forms can be created by just dragging and dropping the text elements and input fields to the canvas. Once a form has been created, it can then be used as process trigger to start the process or added as an approval step in the business process.

Let us now explore how these different forms are created. In the steps below you will create 3 forms which will be used to:
1. Start the approval process
2. Send a task in the inbox of the business user for the approval
3. Notify the requester for approval or rejection.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create Form to Trigger Business Process)]

> First you will create a trigger form that will start the business process. For that you have to  open your process in process builder and add a new form.

1. Click **New Form** in **Trigger Settings**.

    ![Select Starting Node](unit3-00.png)


2. In the pop-up for new form, do the following:
    - Enter the **Name** as **Order Processing Form**.
    - Enter a **Description** of your choice.
    - Choose **Create**.

    > The form **Identifier** field is auto-filled.

    The form will be added as the start trigger.

3. Now it is time to design the **Form** with available layout and input fields options using drag-and-drop feature and simple configurations. All you need to do is drag-and-drop the form fields and enter the given names and field settings.


    |  Form Fields    | Field Settings with Label
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Headline 1         | Order Approval Request Form
    |  Paragraph          |Please provide the necessary information of your order and submit for approvals.


    - For all below **Input Fields** enter the labels and select the **Required** checkbox

    |  Form Fields   |  Field Settings with Label
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    | Text | Customer Name
    | Text | Order Number
    | Number | Order Amount
    | Date | Order Date
    | Text | Expected Delivery Date

    ![Design Form](unit3-03.png)

4. Save the form using **Save** button on top-right corner of the screen.

    ### Your Trigger form are ready!

    ![Trigger Form](unit3-04.png)

As you have added the form to start the process, now you will design the process with more activities related to approval of the sales order.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create and Configure an Approval Form)]

Approval form will be used to get faster and easier approvals from the business users to take informed decisions and getting rid of sending emails. These approval forms could be about approving or rejecting the sales order, invoices, or onboarding, IT requests etc. The forms are then converted into tasks in an automated workflow which will appear in the `MyInbox` of the user.

You can create these different forms using **Form Builder** embedded in the process builder using different form field options. You can drag-and-drop to design and easily modify them without any coding.  

1. Add a **New Approval Form** to the process.

  s![New Approval Form](unit3-10a.png)

2. In the **Create Form** dialog box, do the following:
    - Enter **Approval Form** in the **Name** field.
    - Enter **Form to approve or reject the sales order** in the **Description** field.
    - Choose **Create**.

    ![03-026](unit3-11.png)

3. Design the **Approval Form** in the form builder by simply dragging-and-dropping fields onto the form editor and configuring respective field settings.


  |  Form Fields    | Field Settings with Label
  |  :------------- | :-------------
  | Headline 1 | Approve Sales Order
  | Paragraph  | A new order has been received. Please review and confirm whether the requirements can be met or not.
  | Paragraph  | Sales Order Details:

4.	Save the form using **Save** button on top-right corner of the screen.

    -  In the **Subject** box, enter **Review and Approve Order `select Order Number from the process content` from `select Customer Name from the process content` company**

    - For **Users** in **Recipients**, select **Process Metadata > Process Started By** from process content.

    ![03-027](unit3-13.png)

6.	Similarly, go to **Inputs** tab and map the different input fields (which were marked as read-only in the approval form) by selecting the respective **Process Content** entry.

  > The process content will highlight the entries with same data type of the input field. For Example: If the input field is of Number type then Process Content will show only number-type entries.

    | Form Input Fields| Process Content Entry
