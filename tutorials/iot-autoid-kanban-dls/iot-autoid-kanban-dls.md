## Prerequisites
- You have licensed SAP Internet of Things (with the new capacity unit based licensing introduced in August 2020, your company has a Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement or Pay-As-You-Go for SAP BTP and you have subscribed to the `oneproduct` service plan)
- You have setup the subscription for SAP IoT in your global account in a tenant (e.g. in the DEV tenant, the guide for the basic setup is at [Get Started with Your SAP IoT Account](https://help.sap.com/viewer/195126f4601945cba0886cbbcbf3d364/latest/en-US/bfe6a46a13d14222949072bf330ff2f4.html) ).
- Your SAP User has at a minimum the `iot_role_collection` created during onboarding of your tenant and the associated roles (see [SAP Help on Providing Authorizations in](https://help.sap.com/viewer/195126f4601945cba0886cbbcbf3d364/latest/en-US/2810dd61e0a8446d839c936f341ec46d.html ) )
- You have created destinations for the kanban APIs as described in [Create Destinations for kanban APIs](iot-autoid-kanban-destination)
- You have created a kanban Business Context Hierarchy using the [Activate kanban Business Template](iot-autoid-kanban-bt) tutorial.
- Optional for Event based setup: You have subscribed to SAP Event Mesh and created a Service Instance of it [SAP Help Portal on Creating an Event Mesh Service Instance](https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/d0483a9e38434f23a4579d6fcc72654b.html)
- Optional for Event based setup: You have setup the Business Event Handling in your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system according to [Scope Item 1NN](https://rapid.sap.com/bp/#/browse/scopeitems/1NN) or SAP S/4HANA according to the [Enterprise Event Enablement Documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/810dfd34f2cc4f39aa8d946b5204fd9c/latest/en-US/c200f98fadb64ff1828ed5696c86fca2.html)

## Details
### You will learn
  - What the Business Context Hierarchy for kanban is about
  - How to configure the Business Context Hierarchy to use SAP Enterprise Mesh
  - How to configure the Business Context Hierarchy to use OData polling
  - How to activate the Business Context Hierarchy

The kanban Business Context Hierarchy (created by activating the kanban template) needs to be adjusted to use SAP Enterprise Mesh or polling via OData to query the kanban containers from SAP S/4HANA or SAP S/4HANA Cloud. Furthermore the Auto-ID Event Enrichment needs to be adjusted and activated by you.

SAP Event Mesh enables you to trigger a data load based on Business Event send near real-time.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Access your business context hierarchy)]

The **Business Context Hierarchy** for kanban defines how the kanban container business objects shall be retrieved from SAP S/4HANA Cloud. To view or edit open the app **Business Context Hierarchy** from the Fiori Launchpad in you SAP Internet of Things tenant and search for your Hierarchy (e.g. by filtering on you package name) and open it. In the **General Information** tab you can see **Name**, **Description**, **Package** and the **Activation Status** of the hierarchy. For now leave it in status **Inactive** continue with the next Step.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Adjust the kanban container data load)]

 You now need to adjust the hierarchy for the kanban container business objects from your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. You can either use **SAP Event Mesh** to trigger a data load based on Business Event send by SAP S/4HANA Cloud or using **OData polling**.

>Use the two tabs above to select the option of your choice (SAP Event Mesh or OData polling). The content of this step is then adjusted automatically.

- Open the App **Business Context Hierarchy** and open your sequence which you have created following the tutorial [Activate kanban Business Template](iot-autoid-kanban-bt). Switch to the tab **Business Context Hierarchy** and select the available **Root Node** `kanban_containers` to activate the **Edit** button:

    !![Select the Root Node activate edit](EditDLS1.png)


[OPTION BEGIN [SAP Event Mesh]]

- If you would like to use SAP Event Mesh select as the **Method** `Enterprise Messaging` and enter the following in the shown dialog:

    |  Property Name    | Value           | Remark
    |  :-------------   | :-------------  | :-------------
    |  `Filter Condition`          | **`ProductionSupplyArea eq 'kanban_09'`** | The ID of the Production Supply Area defined in SAP S/4HANA Cloud
    |  `Namespace Prefix`     | **`sap/name/001`** | The prefix you have chosen for your SAP Event Mesh Instance. You can also look it up in the **Service Key** of the SAP Enterprise Mesh Instance.

- Select the **Event Type** `sap.s4.beh.kanbancontrolcycle.v1.KanbanControlCycle.ContainerChanged.v1` as **Changed Lifecycle Event**. If you like you can also use the value help to explore all available **Event Types**.

At the end the configuration should look as follows:

 !![Final SAP Event Mesh Configuration](EMConfiguration.png)

 Finally press **Done** and continue with the next Step.

[OPTION END]


[OPTION BEGIN [OData polling]]

- If you would like to use the polling mechanism via OData you have to choose  `Poll` as **Method** and enter the following in the shown dialog:

    |  Property Name    | Value           | Remark
    |  :-------------   | :-------------  | :-------------
    |  `Filter Condition`          | e.g **`ProductionSupplyArea eq 'kanban_09'`** | of your choice, here the ID of the Production Supply Area defined in SAP S/4HANA Cloud |
    |  `Last Changed Field`     | e.g. **`LastChangeDateTime`** | of your choice  |
    |  `Start Time`             | e.g. **`Today`** | of your choice |
    |  `End Time`               | e.g. **`next two weeks`** | of your choice |
    |  `Every`                  | e.g. **`hour at 00 minutes past the hour'`** | of your choice |


At the end the configuration should look as follows:

!![Final OData Polling configuration](PollingConfig.png)

Finally press **Done** and continue with the next Step.

[OPTION END]

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3:](Activate your business context hierarchy)]

After making the necessary changes you can go ahead an **Activate** your hierarchy. By doing so the configured data load will start. You can see the process of the data load by looking at the **Logs** inside your **Business Context Hierarchy** configuration:

!![Business Context Hierarchy Logs](DataLoadLogs.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4:](Adjust and activate your Auto-ID event enrichment)]
The **Event Enrichment** configures which scanner devices ( `ReadpointID` ) used to determine the presence, absence, or movement of the business objects you're interested in. Moreover, you associate information from the business object (e.g., kanban container) with additional properties that have been collected in the scanning event.

To view or edit the enrichment open the app **Auto-ID Event Enrichment** from the Fiori Launchpad in you SAP Internet of Things tenant and search for you scenario (e.g. by filtering on your package name) and open it.

In the **Filters** section you can see a predefined filter on `ReadpointID`. Change this to **Is One Of** and **`Reader_01, Reader_02`** by clicking on the **Property** name:

!![Adjust filter in the Auto-ID Event Enrichment](AdjustEventEnrichment.png)

After doing so you can go ahead and set the **Event Enrichment** to active by clicking the **Activate** button.
