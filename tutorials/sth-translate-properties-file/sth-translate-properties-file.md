### Create a new file translation project

Choose **+ Add New Project** and then **File Project**.

### Enter translation project details


Now you need to enter the following details about your project on the **Details** tab:

Field Name | Value
:-------------  | :-------------
Project Name | **`fioriapp`**
Domain | **Sales**
Source Language | **English**
File Type | **Java Properties File**
Target Languages   | **Chinese**, **French**, and **German**

You can specify in the **Advanced Settings** if you want to use a company MLTR or a review process.

To simplify the tutorial only select **YES** for **Review Required**. Leave all other fields and selection options as they are and click the button **Proceed to upload file(s)**.

### Upload the file to the translation project


Drag your source file to anywhere in the project or click on the + icon to upload your .properties file.

![Get translations](sth-translate-upload-file.png)!

If everything works as expected, you see the following status:

![Success message](sth-translate-upload-success-status.png)!


### Translate texts in translation project


SAP Translation Hub shows an overview of your translation project. To start the translation process choose the red marked icon and  **Translate without Download** in the bottom right of the screen.

![Get translations](sth-translate-get-translations.png)!


If everything works as expected, you see the following status:

![Success message](sth-translate-success-status.png)!



### Check translations


The translation is now complete, but you might want to review the translations. To do that, choose **Translations**:

![Check translations](sth-translate-translations.png)!

This is where you can switch between the target languages and, in the columns to the right, see the translation provider and a quality status. The higher the number on a scale from 0-100, the better the quality.
> For translations provided by SAP machine translation (SAP MT), the quality index is always 25.

### Update translations (optional)


If you want to change any of the translations, simply make your changes directly in the **Translated Text** column. When you're done, choose **Save Project**. As a final step, download your translations with the button **Download Translations**.

![Download](sth-translate-download-translations.png)!

A zip file is downloaded to your local drive. It contains a separate .properties file for each target language.
