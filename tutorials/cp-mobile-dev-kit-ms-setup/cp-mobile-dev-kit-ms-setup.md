[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Understand the mobile development kit feature)]

The Mobile Development Kit (MDK) enables developers and technical business users to build [multi-channel]((https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/27/moving-to-multi-channel-with-mobile-development-kit/)) applications. It allows you to build your application once, in an integrated development environment, and run it natively on mobile devices (Android & iOS) and as a web application (online) in the browser.

You can find more details in the [Mobile Development Kit developer page](https://developers.sap.com/topics/mobile-development-kit.html).

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Create a new destination to your MDK Web application)]

MDK Web application accesses the data sources via BTP destination. You will now create a new destination in BTP cockpit that will point to the same backend as your Mobile destination.

>The destination that you are going to create in this tutorial is very specific as this connects to the backend via Mobile Services and will use OAuth2JWTBearer authentication type. For other kinds of backend or services, you may skip the following steps and directly setup your BTP destination with the relevant authentication type that is required by the backend.

1. Click `com.sap.mdk.demo` to navigate to Mobile Services application details.

    !![MDK](img-4.1.png)

2. Open the `APIs` tab, click _copy to clipboard_ icon to copy the highlighted URL and paste it in a text file. This URL will be used in configuring the  BTP destination.

    !![MDK](img-4.1.1.png)

3. In your SAP BTP space cockpit page, navigate to the ![Services](icon-services.png) **Services** **&rarr;**  **Instances and Subscriptions**, select **Authorization and Trust Management service** from the list, click `com-sap-mdk-demo-xsuaa` instance, choose ![Security icon in the cockpit](icon-dots.png) **&rarr;** **View** to open the configuration details.

    !![MDK](img-4.2.png)

4. Switch to **Form** tab, copy values for `clientid`, `clientsecret`, `url` parameters and paste these values in the text file. These parameters will be used in configuring the BTP destination.  

    !![MDK](img-4.3.png)

5. Download the zip file from [here](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-mdk-tutorial-samples/blob/master/0-Set-Up-for-the-Mobile-Development-Kit/SampleServiceV2.zip) and unzip it on your machine.

6. Navigate to ![Connectivity](icon-connectivity.png) **Connectivity** **&rarr;** **Destinations** to create a BTP destination, click **Import Destination** to import the extracted file and provide the required information and click **Save**.

    | Field | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `URL` | Paste the URL from step 4.2 |
    | `Client ID` | Paste the value from step 4.4  |
    | `Client Secret` | Paste the value from step 4.4 |
    | `Token Service URL` | Paste the URL from step 4.4 and add **`/oauth/token`** suffix at the end |
    | `Use Default JDK truststore` | Select the checkbox if not selected before |
