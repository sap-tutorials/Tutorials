### Download Updated Packages


Log in as `hxeadm`. Depending on your version of SAP HANA, express edition, you will either use the built-in update utility, or download the new versions of SAP HANA, express edition through the Download Manager. Your primary choice should be the built-in update utility.

* Check the VM's built-in update utility. It can be found in the `home/bin` directory. Follow the prompts to download the new files. By default, they will be downloaded to `/usr/sap/HXE/home/Downloads`. The downloaded files will be `hxe.tgz`, and `hxexsa.tgz` for Applications if applicable.

* Check the VM's built-in update utility found in the `~/home/bin` directory. Depending on your VM, use either `HXECheckUpdate_linux.bin` for `Linux x86-64`, and `HXECheckUpdate.jar` for `Linux PPC64`. Follow the prompts to download the new files. By default, they will be downloaded to `~/usr/sap/HXE/home/Downloads`. The downloaded files will be `hxe.tgz`, and `hxexsa.tgz` for Applications if applicable.

    ```
    HXECheckUpdate_linux.bin -a
    ```

* If you do not have the update utility, use the Download Manager. Select **Binary Installer** and download the latest files for `hxe.tgz` (server-only), and `hxexsa.tgz` (Applications) if applicable.



### Extract the Packages


Login as `hxeadm` and extract the contents of the packages.

Example:

```
su -l <sid>adm
tar -zxf <downloaded_path>/hxe.tgz
tar -zxf <downloaded_path>/hxexsa.tgz
```



### Update the Server Installation


Navigate to the directory where you extracted the packages:

```
cd <extract_path>/HANA_EXPRESS_20/
```

> Note:
> If the update you are applying includes the Applications package, increase your allocated memory by 3GB and run `./hxe_gc.sh`. Follow the prompts and then continue with the procedure.

.

As the root user, run the upgrade script to update the server:

```
sudo ./hxe_upgrade.sh
```

Follow the prompts to complete the server update.

>`hxe_upgrade.sh` detects the Server-only and Applications packages. The script will upgrade the server and XSA (if available).
