# Build and Deploy Your SAP Fiori App to SAP Business Technology Platform
<!-- description --> Build and deploy your SAP Fiori MTA project to your SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment.

## Prerequisites
- The SAP Fiori dev space is in status `RUNNING` and you opened it.
- You completed [Create an SAP Fiori App Using SAP Business Application Studio](appstudio-fioriapps-create).
- For the deployment step, additional prerequisites apply. You need to have the following available in the Cloud Foundry space to which you will log on (see [Add a New Entitlement to Your Subaccount](cp-cf-entitlements-add)):
    - Cloud Foundry Runtime: 1GB free
    - Destination: 1 free
    - HTML5 Applications: 1 free

## You will learn
  - How to build and deploy an application to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment
  - How to configure Cloud Foundry settings in SAP Business Application Studio
  - How to run the deployed app from your space on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment

## Intro
After a period of idle time the dev space is automatically stopped. In order to re-start the dev space open the [dev space manager](https://triallink.eu10.trial.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/), click the **Play** icon, and click the dev space.

The period for idle time for Factory accounts is different than for trial accounts.

### Build the application


1. In the **Explorer** pane, right-click the `mta.yaml` file and select **Build MTA Project**.

    <br><br><!-- border -->![build mta](BAS-Build-1-.png)

    >The build process creates a multi-target archive (`MTAR`) file in your project that packages all the project modules for deployment. You can find the `MTAR` file in the `FioriDemo/mta_archives` folder.

If you are not logged in to a Cloud Foundry space - Before you can deploy your new application, set your Cloud Foundry preferences.

1. In the menu bar, select **View | Find Command** to open the **command palette**.

    ><!-- border -->![deploy success](BAS-Deploy-2-.png)


### Access the application on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment


Run the deployed app on SAP BTP. The steps below show you how to access your new application and run it. You will use CF commands in a terminal for this.

1. On the menu bar select **Terminal | New Terminal**.

    <!-- border -->![open new terminal tab](BAS-Access-App-On-CF-1-.png)

2. A new terminal tab is opened.

    <!-- border -->![new terminal tab opened](BAS-Access-App-On-CF-2-.png)

    >The folder it is opened in is the specific project folder. You can use the following command in the terminal to verify it:
    ```Shell/Bash
    pwd
    ```
    <!-- border -->![pwd](BAS-Access-App-On-CF-3-.png)

3. Open the `mta.yaml` file, and locate the destination service instance name. You can find it in the **modules > requires** section or in the **resources** section. In this tutorial it should be `FioriDemo-destination-service`.

4. Execute the following command in the terminal to get the details of the deployed application and its URL:

    ```Shell/Bash
    cf html5-list -di FioriDemo-destination-service -u -rt launchpad
    ```

    <!-- border -->![details of deployed app on CF](BAS-Access-App-On-CF-4-.png)

    >To find out more about this command execute in the terminal:
    ```Shell/Bash
    cf help html5-list
    ```

5. Press [CTRL] and click the app's link in the terminal.

    <!-- border -->![app url](BAS-Access-App-On-CF-5-.png)

    >You can use this URL in any browser to access your new application in your space on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment.

    >Here we are using the [SAP Launchpad service](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/launchpad-service) you configured in an earlier step. It enables organizations to establish a central point of access to SAP (e.g. SAP S/4HANA), custom-built, and third party applications and extensions, both on the cloud and on premise.

6. The app is running on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment, accessing data from an on-premise backend.
