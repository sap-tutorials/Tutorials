# Add a Web Dynpro ABAP App to your SAP Work Zone
<!-- description --> Add a classic SAP application (like those typically run by SAP customers on the data center backends), to your SAP Work Zone.

## Prerequisites
 - You have created a destination in SAP BTP cockpit to the SAP Gateway Demo System.
 - You have an environment set up and you can access your SAP Work Zone.
 - You have opened SAP Work Zone.

## You will learn
  - How to expose a Web Dynpro ABAP backend application in SAP Work Zone.

## Intro
To add business apps to SAP Work Zone, you configure them in a tool called the **Content Manager**, located in the Site Manager. The **Content Manager** includes various editors that you can use to configure apps, groups, roles, and catalogs. Once configured, the app appears as a tile in the **Applications** page of your site - a single page that acts as an embedded launchpad. The page is accessed from the top-level menu of SAP Work Zone and displays the business apps that the user has permissions to launch.

  <!-- border -->![View app in list](9-view-app.png)

To view the app in runtime, you must assign the app to a role. You also need to assign the app to a group so that it'll be visible in the **Applications** page of your site. This is described in the following steps.



### Assign the app to the Everyone role


>The `Everyone` role already exists in the **Items** list of the **Content Manager** by default. Content assigned to the `Everyone` role is visible to all users.

1. In the **Content Manager** in the **Items** list, click the `Everyone` role to open up the Role editor.

    <!-- border -->![Select everyone role](10-everyone-role.png)

2. Click **Edit**.

    <!-- border -->![Edit everyone role](11-edit-role.png)

3. Click the search box in the **Assignments** panel on the right, any available apps are shown in the list below.

4. Click the **+** icon next to the `Search POs` app to assign the app to the `Everyone` role. You'll see that the icon changes to an **X**.

5. Then click **Save**.

    <!-- border -->![Assign app to role](12-assign-app-to-role.png)

The `Search POs` app is now assigned to the `Everyone` role. In the next step you'll assign the app to a group.


### Assign the app to a group


>A group is a set of one or more apps displayed together in the **Applications** page of your site. Assigning apps to groups, makes them visible to users.

1. Click the icon in the side panel to navigate back to the **Content Manager**.

2. Click **+ New** and select **Group** to open the Group editor.

    <!-- border -->![Create a new group](13-new-group.png)

3. Name the group `Purchase Orders`.

4. In the **Assignments** panel, click inside the search box on the right of the screen, to show all available apps. You should see the  `Search POs` app.  

5. In the list, click **+** to assign the `Search POs` app to your group.

    You'll see that the icon changes to an **X**.

6. Click **Save**.

    <!-- border -->![Assign app to group](14-assign-app-to-group.png)

    Now that the app is configured, it is automatically added to the **Applications** screen in your site. You can also add it to one of your workpages.


### View the app in the Applications screen


1. Click the **Site Directory** icon in the side panel.

    <!-- border -->![Open Work Zone directory](15-open-workzone-directory.png)

2. Click the **Open site** icon.

    <!-- border -->![Open work zone](16-open-workzone.png)

3. In the top-level menu of your site, click **Applications**.

    <!-- border -->![Open Applications page](17-open-applications-page.png)

You'll see your app is displayed as a tile in the group you assigned it to:
