## Prerequisites
- **Tutorial:** [Set Up Business Application Studio for Mobile Technologies](cp-mobile-bas-setup)
- **Download and install:** **SAP Mobile Services Client** on your [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sap-mobile-services-client/id1413653544) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sap.mobileservices.client) device (If you are connecting to `AliCloud` accounts then you will need to brand your [custom MDK client](cp-mobile-dev-kit-build-client) by allowing custom domains.)

## Details
### You will learn
  - How to configure an application in Mobile Services
  - How to define a REST endpoint as a destination in Mobile Services
  - How to define a REST endpoint as a destination in Cloud Foundry
  - How to create MDK applications in SAP Business Application Studio
  - How to create a MDK Service file pointing to REST endpoint destination
  - How to use `RestService SendRequest` Action to make directly call to `Petstore` API

You may clone an existing project from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-mdk-tutorial-samples/tree/master/4-Level-Up-with-the-Mobile-Development-Kit/8-Consume-rest-api-in-mdk-app) and start directly with step 7 or 17 in this tutorial but make sure you complete step 2&3.

Mobile Development Kit allows you to consume REST APIs. You need to first define REST endpoint as a destination and then easily bind a `RestServiceTarget` to an MDK control e.g., `ObjectTable`, `ContactCell`, `ObjectCollection` etc. This assumes the REST service returns JSON similar to how OData requests are returned.

A publicly available `Petstore` API from [swagger.io](https://petstore.swagger.io) is used as an example in this tutorial.

![MDK](img_17.1.png)

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Understand the Petstore API to retrieve data)]

1. Open [`Swagger Petstore`](https://petstore.swagger.io/), find all pets with status as `available`.

    !![MDK](img_1.1.png)

2. Click **Execute** to get the response.

    !![MDK](img_1.2.png)

    By looking at results, you now have understood

    -	what is the Request URL to retrieve pet information
    -	what is header parameter to be passed in GET call
    -	what is the response code
    -	how the response body looks like

With above details, you will next configure an app in Mobile Services, add root of request URL as a destination and then consume it in MDK.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Run the app)]

[OPTION BEGIN [Android]]

>Make sure you are choosing the right device platform tab above. Once you have scanned and onboarded using the onboarding URL, it will be remembered. When you Log out and onboard again, you will be asked either to continue to use current application or to scan new QR code.

SAP Business Application Studio has a feature to generate QR code for app onboarding.

Click the `Application.app` to open it in MDK Application Editor and click **Application QR Code** icon to display the QR code.

!![MDK](img-7.1.png)

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 9: ](Understand the Petstore API to create new record)]

1. In [`Swagger Petstore`](https://petstore.swagger.io/), add a new pet to the store.

    !![MDK](img_9.1.png)

    There is payload example to be passed for adding a new pet.

2. For testing, use below payload.

    -	what are header parameters to be passed in POST call
    -	what is the response code
    -	how the response body looks like

With above details, you will now create a new MDK rule to create a new Pet record.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 10: ](Create new page for new pet record)]

2. Enter the Page Name `Pet_Create` and click **Next** and the **Finish** on the Confirmation step.

    !![MDK](img_10.2.png)

3. In the **Properties** pane, set the **Caption** to **Create Pet**.

    !![MDK](img-10.3.png)

4. Now, you will add the fields (Pet name and Status) for creating a new pet record by the end-user.

    In the Layout Editor, expand the **Control** | **Container Item** section. Drag and drop a **Simple Property** onto the Page area.

    >You can find more details about [available controls in Form Cell page](https://help.sap.com/doc/69c2ce3e50454264acf9cafe6c6e442c/Latest/en-US/docs-en/reference/schemadoc/Page/FormCell/Container.schema.html).

    !![MDK](img_10.4.gif)

5. Drag and drop one more Simple Property control onto the page so you have two total controls.

    !![MDK](img_10.5.png)

6. Select the first **Simple Property control** and provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Name`| `FCCreatePet` |
    | `Caption` | `Pet Name` |
    | `PlaceHolder`| `Enter Value` |

    !![MDK](img-10.6.png)
