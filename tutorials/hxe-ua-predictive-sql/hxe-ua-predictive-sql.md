# Predictive Analytics Using SQL Scripts
<!-- description --> This tutorial series will cover two approaches to a sample project utilizing the predictive analytics capabilities of SAP HANA, express edition. This tutorial will show you how to use SQL scripts with the predictive analytics library.

## You will learn  
  - How to use predictive analytics with a pre-written SQL script

## Intro
This tutorial describes one of many SAP HANA Academy Predictive Analysis Library tutorials. For more tutorials on using Predictive Analysis Library, see the [SAP HANA Academy YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkzo92owKnVw05sPUtcKJM66fYfk9sG-g).

### Memory Cleanup (VM only)

Before running the script on your VM installation, you will need to clean up the memory processes.

Open a command line to your VM and run the following commands:

```bash
hdbcons "resman shrink"
```

```bash
hdbcons "mm gc -f"
```

```bash
hdbcons -e hdbnameserver "resman shrink"
```

```bash
hdbcons -e hdbnameserver "mm gc -f"
```




### Copy the First SAP HANA Academy Script


Go to the [SAP HANA Academy GitHub](https://github.com/saphanaacademy) site. Click on the **PAL** repository. From there, navigate to **Code Snippets** -> **`PAL 110 Time Series - Auto ARIMA Model.sql`**.

![GitHub ARIMA Model](github_arima_model_1.png)

Click on **Raw**.

Use the keys _Ctrl_ + _a_ to select all, and _Ctrl_ + _c_ to copy the script.



### Run the Model SQL Script


Open an SQL command line to your **tenant** database through your **new user**. Paste the script and click the Execute icon ![Execute](execute.png) to run the code. The **Result** page appears.

>**Note:**
> This script assumes the user name is **DEVUSER**. If you created a user with a different name, you will need to modify the script by replacing the instances of **DEVUSER** with your user's name.

>**Note:**
> The first time you run this script, you may receive the errors _Could not execute 'DROP TYPE ...'_ and the error _Could not execute 'DROP TABLE "#PARAMS"'_. This is expected behavior as these elements are created in the script. The errors will not affect output.

This builds the model used for predictive analysis.



### Copy the Second SAP HANA Academy Script


Go back to the [SAP HANA Academy GitHub](https://github.com/saphanaacademy) site. Click on the **PAL** repository. From there, navigate to **Code Snippets** -> **`PAL 111 Time Series - Auto ARIMA Predict.sql`**.

![GitHub ARIMA Predict](github_arima_predict_1.png)

Click on **Raw**.

![GitHub ARIMA Predict Raw](github_arima_predict_raw_1.png)

Use the keys _Ctrl_ + _a_ to select all, and _Ctrl_ + _c_ to copy the code.



### Run the Predict SQL Script


Back in your command line, paste the script and click the **Execute** icon ![Execute](execute.png) to run the code. A new *Result* page appears. This creates a predictive analysis table from the model you created earlier.

>**Note:**
> This script assumes the user name is **DEVUSER**. If you created a user with a different name, you will need to modify the script by replacing the instances of **DEVUSER** with your user's name.

### View the Results


To preview the data, go to your user login to your tenant database and cascade down to **Catalog** -> **`USER`** -> **Views**. Right-click on **`V_Results`** and click **Open Data Preview**.

![Open Data Preview](open_data_preview_2.png)

From there, you can view the raw data or create charts under the *Analysis* tab.
