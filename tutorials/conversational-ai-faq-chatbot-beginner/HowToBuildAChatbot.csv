Question,Answer
"Is it possible to go to another skill if a user clicks yes\no ?
","Sure you can. Use ""Redirect to SKILL and start the skill"". For this, you should create a requirement in the ""Requirements"" tab for an answer to be present. For more information see [Requirements]( https://help.sap.com/viewer/a4522a393d2b4643812b7caadfe90c18/latest/en-US/c09ef2abdb044aaaa43025e5138b3f73.html)
"
What is a skill?,"A skill is a block of conversations that has a clear purpose and that your bot can execute to achieve a goal. It can be as simple as the ability to greet someone, but it can also be more complex, like giving a movie suggestion based on information provided by the user."
What is an intent? ,An intent is a box of expressions that mean the same thing but are constructed in different ways. Intents are the heart of your bot's understanding. Each one of your intents represents an idea your bot is able to understand.
How do I build a chatbot? ,"To create your chatbot Click + New Bot at the top right of the page. You should then see a page appear with a series of fields. 

1) Enter a name and a description(optional).

2) (Optional) Add up to six topics to your bot (for example, Customer Support, HR, Payments, etc.). By categorizing your bot in this way, we can suggest more appropriate training data to improve it later.

3) Set the default language. You can add more languages later.

4) Select the appropriate Data Policy. Choose the type of end uder that this bot can be accessed by.

5) Specify whether your bot is public or private.

6) Click CREATE A BOT.

How would you recemmond structuring an intent? ,"Make sure your intents are distinct enough to avoid misunderstandings and unnecessary confusion
Balance your intents: try to have the same amount of expressions in each of them
Diversify your intents: use as many different grammatical structures as you can"
How would you recommend structuring an intent?,
Can you give me an example of intents? ,"Here are some example intents for when someone asks for help. Just create an intent called `help` and fill it with every expression a user would say when asking for guidance.

Could you help me?
I'm lost, give me a hand please.
Can you help?
What can you do for me?"
What is an entity? ,"An entity is a keyword that is extracted from an expression. We automatically detect 28 different entities such as Datetime, Location, Person, and so on. We call them gold entities. However, you're not limited to these gold entities. You can also tag your own custom entities to detect keywords depending on your bot's context, such as subway stations if you're building a transport assistant. "
What is a gold entity? ,"Gold entities are entities that are detected automatically for our advanced languages. To bring you a precise service with true added value, we enrich each gold entity with essential core information. For example, when the gold entity `tomorrow` is detected in a sentence, a formatted version of the datetime that you can use as a reply is returned. You are not able to deactivate or train them. "
What is the difference between restricted custom entities and free custom entities? ,"Free custom entities are used when you don't have a strict list. For example, you want your bot to detect book titles. Restricted Entities are used when you have a closed list. For example, a list of possible orders from a menu. "
How do I create a restrictred custom entity?,"To create a restricted custom entity: In SAP Conversational AI go to Entities, click CREATE, and select Restricted entity. Then add values (synonyms) for this entity. You can also upload a CSV file or use the gazette endpoint of the API to quickly create a large list of synonyms."
What would I use the build tab for? ,"You can use the build tab to create your conversation flow. README.md: Where you explain the purpose of the skill.

Triggers: Where you define why this skill should be activated after a user message.

Requirements: What information this skill has to collect, and what questions need to be asked to fulfill the requirements.

Actions: What to do once the requirements are fulfilled."
What is the purpose of sentiment information? ,"Sentiment analysis detects the feeling of a users sentence. Measuring this in varying levels of positive, and negative input, alows you build a conversation flow around the feeling of the user. For example, if your user responds with a very positive response when making a purchase you may want to see if they are interested in other items similar to the one they just bought. "
What type of sentiment data do you collect? ,"Our sentiment analysis spans 5 categories, very positive (It was awesome to see that man eat a peach), positive (The man ate a peach), neutral (peach), negative (Sadly, the man did not eat a peach), and very negative (It was awful when the man ate the peach). "
What does sentence acts mean? ,"We currently detect 4 acts of a sentence, as defined in the section 8.7 ofÂ Natural Language Understanding, 1995, James Allen. Those 4 categories are defined as surface speech acts, which indicate how the proposition described is intended to be used to update the discourse situation. 
1) assert: The proposition is being asserted ie: The man ate a peach. 
2) command: The proposition describes an action to perform ie: Eat a peach 
3) wh-query: The proposition describes an object to be identified	ie: What did the man eat? 
4) yn-query	The proposition is being queried ie: Did the man eat a peach?	"
What is a sentence type? ,A sentence type comes from the task of question classification in the domain of Question Answering Systems. Detecting the type of a question helps you define what the answer to your user's request needs to be. For an exhaustive list of sentence types we support go to this [link] (https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/sentence-types)
What are the advanced languages? ,"Our advanced languages have some additional support compared to our standard languages. Specifically, the advanced languages have gold entities automatically tagged, sentiment detection for each user utterance, and act and type detection. If a language is standard that means that the bot has intent detection, custom entities, and language detection. 

Our advanced languages are English, French, Spanish, and German. If a language is advanced it means that the bot has intent detection, custom entities, gold entities, sentiment analysis, act and type detection enrichments, and language detection. 
"
In which languages can I build a bot?  ,The platform will work in any language. We have some languages that have advanced and standard features. 
What is a condition?,"A condition is a test that can be evaluated to either true or false.

You can find conditions in different sections of your skill:

in the triggers
in the requirements
in each group of actions."
How do I use memory for my conversation? ,Check out this article on how to use memory in your conversation flow https://cai.tools.sap/blog/mastering-memory-management-bot-builder/
What is a webhook?,"At many points in your conversation, you most likely want to retrieve business information or connect to an external system to perform actions. You can do this through webhooks. A webhook is a simple HTTP call to your backend. To configure your HTTP call, click CALL WEBHOOK in the Bot Builder.
"
How do I call a webhook?,"To call a webhook you can provide the full URL or route (starting with a â€˜/') to be called by the Bot Builder. If you provide a route, the Bot webhook base URL (configurable in your bot's settings) will be prepended to it.

You can specify the HTTP method to use in your webhook call (GET, POST, PUT, or PATCH)."
What channels can I connect my chatbot to?,"Here are the channels that are supported by the platform. Custom webchat as a channel, Callr, Cisco Webex Teams, kik, LINE, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Slack, SAP Jam, Telegram, Twilo, Twitch, Twitter, Amazon Alexa, or SAP CoPilot.  "
How does conversation memory work? ,"Each conversation with a unique user has a memory object from the beginning to the end of the conversation. This memory persists during the entire conversation; you can update it at any time or clear it whenever you want.

When a new conversation starts, the memory is an empty object (unless you want to start a new conversation with prefilled keys). The memory is stored in your conversation state. It is returned in the default body of a webhook and after the Bot Builder API call."
How do I manipulate memory in the platform?,The memory can be filled automatically through the requirements or manually through a configuration of an edit memory action.
Can you start a conversation with memory?,"You can start a conversation with prefilled information in the memory, and not wait until the first user input is analyzed and the first skills are triggered. However, this is only possible if you are using the Bot Builder directly (without the Bot Connector). To understand how to use the Bot Builder API to do this, see /Dialog (Text) in the API Reference.

If you're using Webchat, you can easily start a conversation by sending information in the memory. For more information, see Bot memory management."
What type of messages can you send on the platform?,"Many different formats are supported, enabling you to build an awesome user experience for your bots. For example, text, card, buttons, quick replies, carousel, lists, and images. "
Why does my message look different on one channel versus another?,"If your bot is connected to a channel through the Bot Connector, these messages types are adapted to the channel constraint and transformed, so the look and feel will probably change compared with what you see on the SAP Conversational AI platform.
"
What are the variables I can use in my replies? ,"You can create all of the following variables:

{{conversation_id}}: ID of the current conversation.
{{participant_data}}: An object filled with participant information that is provided by the channel connected through the Bot Connector. By default, you always have a username. You can easily use {{participant_data.username}}.
{{memory}}: The complete memory object. You can access each element like {{memory.person.raw}}. Here, person is the alias of a requirement.
{{skill_occurences}}: Number of consecutive occurrences of the current skill.
{{language}}: Language ISO code of the current conversation.
{{current_message}}: The message source sent by the user.
{{#entity}}: An alias of the nlp.entities object. You can access each element like {{#entity.confidence}} where confidence is nlp.entities.confidence.
{{message_received_at}}: Timestamp of when the message was received.
{{nlp}}: The full nlp object. You can access any property of it like {{nlp.sentiment}} for example if you want to get the sentiment property."
How do I send rich messages? ,"To send a message, you need to make a post request with your bot's Request Token available in your bot settings and send specific payload for each message type.
"
What are the payloads I can use for buttons?,"In the following payloads, buttons can either be:

postback: the basic type, once the button is tapped, the value is sent as a normal incoming message
web_url: depending on the channel, once this button is tapped, the URL in the value field is loaded
phone_number: depending on the channel, once this button is tapped, the phone number in the value field will be called"
Can I import data from other platforms? ,"We allow you to import data to the platform to help you speed up your bot development process using our import function. To keep the training effort low and make it easier for you to move to our platform you can import intents, expressions, and your own custom entities. Currently, we support both: CSV and JSON format for importing your NLP data.
"
Can I do user authentication? ,"This user authentication concept is only available if you're using the Bot Builder API directly (not through the Bot Connector), for example, through your dedicated webchat in your website. If you know that your user is logged in to your website, this authentication concept lets you use a token, cookie session, or user ID to authenticate the webhook call in  SAP Conversational AI."
When should I use a floating and a business skill?,There is no execution difference between business and floating skills. The only thing that changes is the color to help you navigate through your flow.
How many examples should I have per intent?,An intent should contain at least 30 expressions.
What is a trigger? ,"
Triggers are conditions that determine whether the bot should execute the current skill or not.

If the trigger conditions of the skill are validated, the bot will execute it over other skills.

If a skill has no triggers, it will never be executed by a user input, but only if it is at the end of a redirection by another skill."
Why should I add a topic? ,You should add a topic to organize your bots by category. It can also help you share your skills and intents per topic area. 
How different do my intents need to be? ,"Train your bot with diversified expressions. In the following example, note how the expressions are structured differently. They try to anticipate the different ways that your user might ask for something. If all the expressions were structured the same way, for example, I'd like pizza, I'd like burger â€¦, I'd like salad, your bot will have less success understanding the user."
What is a fallback channel? ,A fallback channel allows you to redirect your conversation to a human. We have an Intercom and a SAP Customer Engagaement Center Fallback Channel. 
What is a requirement?,"Requirements are either intents or entities that your skill needs to retrieve before executing actions. Requirements are pieces of information that are important in the conversation and that your bot can use, for example, the user's name or a location.

Once a requirement is completed, the associated value is stored in the bot's memory for the entire conversation."
"What is the difference between non personal data, personal data, and sensetive personal data?","Non personal data is data that is not related to your users or anyone. Personal data is data that could possibly identify a user or people that are related to your users (includes gender race and geographic location). Sensetive personal data is name, address, social secuirty number, phone number, email address, and any other data that can identify a user. "
How do I create an organization?,"Anyone can create an organization. Navigate to your profile and select the ""+"" sign under your profile picture. Your organization can be private or public. For more information go here https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/organization-account
"
What is an organization? ,"Organizations are shared accounts, allowing groups of people to collaborate on many bots at the same time. Administrators manage member access to an organization's bots.
"
How do I change my profile picture? ,Create a gravatar profile to change your profile picture. 
How do I transfer ownership of my bot?,"To transfer an existing bot, go to the Settings page for the bot. Under Danger Zone, you can can then transfer the bot to one of your organizations."
Can I add a welcome message to my bot? ,You can add a welcome message only on Webchat.
Can I have different versions of the same bot?,"A version is a package of your bot training dataset and skills. Each version is independent of the others and can be managed individually. For example, you might want to create a new version prior to major updates to your training dataset or skills. Additionally, separate versions may be useful if you want to leverage two variations of the same core bot.
"
How do I turn on versioning?,"To enable versioning for your bot:

Go to the Settings page for your bot.
Under VERSION SETTINGS, activate versioning.
At the top of the page, you'll now see a dropdown to create and switch to different versions. 
Note: Once you enable versioning for your bot, you can't disable it."
How do I create a version?,"By default, your bot has only one main version v1. 
You can create a new version under VERSION SETTINGS or in the dropdown near the bot name. 
Click CREATE NEW VERSION and select the version you want to copy. 
This copies the Train and Build tabs of the source version and creates a new version that you can then name. The new version is a pure copy; you can update the new version or the old one separately."
How many versions can I have per bot? ,"Bots are restricted to five or fewer versions.
"
Can I filter by version in the monitor tab?,"On the Monitor tab, you can filter all of the metrics by environment and version. For example, you can opt to see only the log feed for the STAGING environment or only the usage metrics for the PRODUCTION environment.
"
What is the pricing?,The platform is free for individual users. For inquiries about commercial use please reach out to justine.baron@sap.com
"Is it possible to have an on premise deployment of SAP Conversational AI?
 ",SAP Conversational AI is a cloud company. You are not able to have an on premise deployment. 
How can I add behaviors to the webchat?,"If you want to customize the style or add new functionalities that don't exist in the default hosted version, you can fork the open-source version on GitHub at SAPConversationalAI/Webchat.
"
What are the gold entities? ," Entities that are already created and pre-trained. We have 28 gold entities. Here is the list of our gold entities: Cardinal, Color, Datetime, Distance, Duration, Email, Emoji, ip, Languague, Number, Ordinal, Organization, Phone, Pronoun, Percent, Person, Set, Sort, Speed, Temperature, URL, and Volume"
What year was recast founded? ,"Recast.AI was founded in September of 2015 by Jasmine Anteunis, Julien Blancher, Paul Renvoise and Patrick Joubert. The company was started in Paris, France. "
What can you do? ,I will answer your questions about the SAP Conversational AI Documentation. You can find more details at https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/create-builder-bot
Which authentication methods for webhooks?,We support Oauth and Basic Auth 
What parameters do you need for /request APIs? ,"All your requests must contain a header called Authorization, with a value of this form: Token DEVELOPER_TOKEN.  We encourage you to use request token on nothing else but your client side. Your developer token must only be used on the server side to manage your bots."
When was Recast.AI acquired by SAP? ,"In January 2018, Recast.AI was acquired by SAP. "
How does my bot understand the text of a user? ,Bots use Natural Language Processing or NLP to understand the user utterances and map them to intents and entities that allow you to build a conversation flow. 
How do I use the messages I receive from my bot connector? ,"When you receive messages from Bot Connector, the body of the request contains various useful information that your bot can leverage to reply to the sender. For more information click here https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/receive-messages"
Can you tell me about the fallback skill?,A fallback skill is triggered if there is nothing else is triggered. You may only have one fallback skill per builder. 
What are the components of my skill?,"A skill is made of three distinct parts:

triggers: conditions determining if the skill should or shouldn't be activated
requirements: determining the information the bot needs to retrieve from the user, and how to retrieve it
actions: performed by the bot when all requirements are complete (for example, send a message)"
What predefined skills can I use for my bot?,"You can choose one or several predefined skills to use as a starting point for your chatbot. You're free to modify them if you don't like them as such, or even delete them once you're ready to make your own.

Here is the starter pack that contains a greeting, small talk, weather, customer satisfaction, and set alarm skill https://cai.tools.sap/scaffolder/starter-skills/train/intents"
What should I know before starting my bot building process?,"Here are the first steps to understand the core concepts of the SAP Conversational AI platform. You'll then be able to build a chatbot that can manage an entire conversation with a user.

A chatbot is composed of two main elements: Skills and a training dataset.

A skill is a block of conversation that has a clear purpose and that your bot can execute to achieve a goal. You need to configure these skills to build the scope of your bot.

A training dataset is composed of many sentences organized into intents that represent what users say to your chatbot. The training dataset is used to train the bot to understand the user's needs and to trigger the right piece of conversation, reply correctly, and have a smooth conversation.
"
What is an enviornment? ,"Environments are configurations applied to specific versions and help you to seamlessly deploy your chatbot in production. They are best leveraged as specific consumption environments, for example, Development, Staging, and Production. 
For more information on versioning and enviornments check out the further documentation here:https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/versioning"
What is SAP CoPilot?,SAP CoPilot is the digital assistant for the enterprise. 
What is SAP Conversational AI? ,"SAP Conversational AI is a platform that allows you to build, train, connect, and monitor your intellegent chatbots.  "
How do I access my enviornment request token?,"Each environment has a dedicated request token. This means that if you want to analyze a text with the /request endpoint or use the Bot Builder API with the /dialog API, you can either provide a version token or an environment token.

If you provide an environment token in your request, it uses the version of your chatbot that is linked to this environment."
How does the Bot Builder API (without Bot Connector) work?,"If you're directly using the Bot Builder endpoint /dialog without a channel in the Bot Connector, the best practice is to use environment request tokens and not version tokens.

In your code, when you request SAP Conversational AI and send a message, it will always be on the same environment, for example, the PRODUCTION environment. When you need to deploy a new version of your chatbot to your users, you just need to go to the Settings page for your bot and, under VERSION SETTINGS, change the version that is linked to the PRODUCTION environment.
You don't need to change the request token in your code because it's the same environment that you're requesting; you simply switch to a different version in the settings."
How does versioning affect my monitor tab?,"Once you have enabled versioning your monitor tab will have some additional fields. 
On the Monitor tab, you can filter all of the metrics by environment and version. For example, you can opt to see only the log feed for the STAGING environment or only the usage metrics for the PRODUCTION environment.
"
How do versions and enviornments work together?,"Since each environmentis linked to a version, it's really easy to deploy a new version to a production environment. 
Let's say for example you had two facebook messanger channels: one for DEVELOPMENT and one for PRODUCTION. Your ""Version 1"" is linked to your DEVELOPMENT enviornment and your ""Version 2"" is linked to your PRODUCTION enviornment.  
Then are using your ""Version 2"" to make some edits and finally you feel like it is ready to become the new PRODUCTION bot. All you need to do is go to your settings page and click on VERSION SETTINGS then clock on the drop down near your production envrionment and assign it to your new version ""Version 2"".
For a more detailed view of this process, check out the documentaiton here: https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/versioning
"
Can you assign a version to multiple enviornments? ,"You can assign a version to multiple environments. However, you can assign only one version to each environment.
"
Can you use the bot builder without the bot connector?,"Yes, you can use the bot builder without the bot connector. In order to do this, you need to retrieve the user input by yourself, for example, through a channel that you've implemented. You then directly request the Bot Builder API and follow the Dialog endpoints documentation in the API Reference to create a new conversation.
https://cai.tools.sap/docs/api-reference/#dialog-text"
How does the go-to skill work?,The go-to skill allows you to to connect two skills together. It skips triggers and automatically goes to the next skill. Please not that it does not skip requirements. 
What message types do each of the channels support?,"For imformation on the message types that each channel supports, I would recemmond looking at the comparison grid on this page of the documentation https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/channel"
What is the training analytics area in my monitor tab?,"On the Monitor tab, the Training Analytics section helps you to build a great dataset for your bot. These analytics are only available for bots with at least 5 intents and at least 30 expressions per intent.

Your dataset (that is, all the intents and entities that you created and trained) is a fundamental element of your bot. If your bot isn't well-trained (meaning your dataset isn't well-structured or is incomplete), your bot won't be able to correctly understand messages from its users, resulting in a disappointing conversational experience.
"
How long does my dataset benchmark take for training analytics?,"A benchmark can take several hours, depending on the size of your bot.
"
How do I run my training analytics benchmark?,"At the top of the page, you can run a benchmark. It will trigger several processes to measure the performance of your dataset and give you insights on how to improve your intent classification and your custom entity detection.

You can only run one benchmark at a time for your bot.
"
Can I update my dataset while my benchmark is processing?,"For more accurate results, we use your bot training data and a validation file that you provide. Since we take your bot training data at a time t, and provide tips and insights based on this data, we advise you not to update your dataset during the benchmark; otherwise the insights will be less accurate."
What is the validation file for training analytics? ,"A validation file is composed of sentences with their corresponding intents. It reflects the reality, so it's important to build this file with real sentences that users actually sent to your bot.

Each sentence is tested with your training dataset, and we check if the first intent returned is the right one. Once the evaluation is done, we also get four metrics between 0 and 1 for each intent (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score) and one global metric."
What does accuracy mean? ,"Accuracy is a global grade on the performance of your bot. It's the proportion of successful classifications out of all of the predictions conducted during your benchmark. While it's a good indication of performance for bots with balanced intents, it may be biased for unbalanced bots."
What does precision mean?,"Precision is a metric that is calculated per intent. For each intent, it measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all the times the intent was declared during the benchmark. It answers the question Out of all the times my bot predicted this intent, how many times was it correct? Low precision usually signifies the relevant intent needs cleaning, which means removing sentences that don't belong to this intent.

For your bot users, a low precision means The bot always thinks I'm talking about A, no matter what I say!"
What does Recall mean? ,"Recall is also a metric calculated per intent. For each intent, it measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all the entries belonging to this intent. It answers the question Out of all the times my bot was supposed to detect this intent, how many times did it do so? Low recall usually signifies the relevant intent needs more training, for example, by adding more sentences to enrich the training.

For your bot users, a low recall means I can't get the bot to understand that I want to do B!"
What is a F1 Score?,"F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and the recall. It's a good indication for the performance of each intent, ranging from 0 (bad performance) to 1 (good performance). The F1 scores for each intent can be averaged to create a global indication for the performance of your bot.

For your bot users, a low F1 score means This is completely useless!"
What is the format for the validation file? ,"File format

Your file must be a valid CSV file. It must end with .csv and the separator must be a semi-colon “;”. If you want to include quotes in your expressions or intents, you must add two double quotation marks before and after the quoted word(s).

""intent"";""expression""
	""greetings"";""Hello""
	""greetings"";""Hi""
	""weather"";""What’s the weather in Paris?""
	""translation"";""What does """"Bonjour"""" in French mean?""

For multilingual bots, please upload one file for each supported language.
"
What is the goal of the validation file? ,"The goal of your validation file is to represent reality, that is, to show how users use your bot. Real user entries should include dedicated vocabulary, typos, etc. The proportion to which each intent is present in your file should also reflect the way real users use your bot. Here are some guidelines:

Try to represent almost all intents in your bot. It's okay if a few intents, far from the core of your bot's use case, are missing. However, at least 85% of the intents should be represented in the validation file.
Provide many sentences for each intent. Don't choose some sentences over others.
Check that all sentences in your file match an existing intent in your bot.
Avoid duplicate sentences.

For more infomration ask me, ""How can I use my logfeed to setup my validation file?"" "
What should be contained in my validation file and how can I use my logfeed to help me create it? ,"To ensure that your validation file reflects the way that people actually use your bot, we recommend creating your file as follows:

1) On the Monitor tab, go to the Log Feed section and filter only matched logs from the past 1 to 3 months.
2) Export these logs by clicking Merge duplicate logs on a single line.
3) Randomly pick the number of logs you need (as a rule of thumb, your bot intent count * 50).
4) Check manually (yes, you need to be the final validator!) that each sentence matches the right intent.
5) Create the final validation file with these sentences and intents.

If your file doesn't include at least 85% of your intents, you need to pick sentences from your logs to complete your file and reach approximately 85%. You can do this as follows:

1) Go back to your Log Feed page and search for the specific intents that are missing.
2) Select between 3 and 10 sentences for each missing intent, and add these sentences to your validation file.

Final step Upload your file to the platform. We'll analyze it and provide feedback. For example, we may suggest adding more sentences. You can still run a benchmark at any time; these guidelines are just suggestions."
What is the intent confusion matrix? ,"Your confusion matrix is used to gain further insight into intents that may clash and get confused. The element at the intersection of row A and column B signifies the percentage of sentences that should be classified as A, but are classified as B.

You can order the confusion matrix by intent name and by performance. If you don't have any problems between your intents, you should have a confusion matrix with a beautiful diagonal since 100% of expressions match the right intent, as expected."
What is included in the tips to improve my intent classification? ,"In addition to benchmark metrics, we provide step-by-step suggestions to improve your dataset in a more accurate way. If the suggestions are not meaningful for you, click Next tips. Here's a prioritized list of the suggestions we may make. 
1. Remove expressions
2. Avoid duplicates
3. Add expressions
4. Merge Intents 
5. Split Intent 

For more information about the above suggestions, type in more information about [suggestion name]"
More information about remove expressions ,"Remove expressions
We can detect that a lot of testing examples of some intents are falsely predicted as another intent. Moreover, we check if the number of training examples of this intent is more than 50% larger than the median number of examples in your dataset (it is said to be unbalanced). As a result, the algorithm may learn to increase the importance and detection rate of this intent. To prevent that, we advise removing any misclassified examples."
More information about avoid duplicates ,"Avoid duplicates
Machine learning algorithms are excellent at predicting the results of data that they encountered during the training step. Duplicates could end up in the training set and testing set, and abnormally improve the benchmark results."
More information about add expressions ,"Add expressions
We check if some intents have a low recall (see definition above). Since there is no balance problem in your dataset, our machine learning strategy is unable to capture the globality of the semantic complexity of this intent. You may be able to solve this by adding more training examples."
More information about merge intents ,"Merge intents
Two intents may be too close semantically to be efficiently distinguished. A significant part of the error of one intent is directed toward the second one, and vice versa. Merging them may help improve the bot's flow."
More information about split intents,"Split intent
If an intent has both low precision and low recall, while the recall scores of the other intents are acceptable, it may reflect a use case that is too broad semantically. Try splitting this intent into several intents."
What is the reality check?,"The reality check allows you to ensure that your dataset represents what users are saying when they talk to your bot. 
Before you can carry out a reality check, you must first upload a validation file (enter ""How do I create a validation file?"" for more information) 

"
How do I create a validation file for my reality check?,"Under Make your dataset closer to reality, choose an intent in the dropdown. You'll then get metrics about how close your training dataset is to reality (from your validation file), as well as suggestions to improve your dataset. For example, you can find the length of the expressions in your training dataset compared with the medium length of the sentences sent by your users. You can also find the most important words in your intent compared with the most important words when your users chat. If some words are missing in your dataset, or if some words are never used by your users, we provide tips to help you solve the issue."
What is my entity detection benchmark?,"Your entity detection benchmark 
We split the expressions inside each intent into two parts: 90% is used for training, 10% is used to evaluate the custom entity detection. The evaluation is simple: We detect each custom entity in each sentence, based on the knowledge we have from the training dataset. We check if each word has been properly detected as a custom entity or as a simple word. We repeat this process five times to enforce randomness in the splits. This results in four metrics between 0 and 1 for each entity (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score) and four global metrics for the entire dataset."
What is my entity detection confusion matrix? ,"Your entity detection confusion matrix
Your confusion matrix is used to gain further insight into entities that may clash and get confused. The element at the intersection of row A and column B signifies the percentage of entities that should be detected as A, but are detected as B.
"
What are tips I could get to improve my entity detection?,"Below are the different suggestions you could get to improve your entity detection
Remove values
Too many words are tagged as custom entities in your chatbot. Custom entities should be used and tagged on words only if you really need them to detect and retrieve key information from your users.

Add different values
You're using the same value too many times in this entity. This can be intentional if you want to check that something is present or not (and you don't need to detect several values). If this is the case, please ignore this tip. If not, you may want to either delete this entity because you're not really using it, or add different values.

Remove mistagging errors
A custom entity is always confused with another one. You may have a tagging issue. For example, some values may be tagged in both entities, or an entity is mistagged. If it's not a mistagging issue, the entities may be too similar; check whether you can merge them."
Is there a limit to the amount of characters in a message?,"On the platform, we display a character limit for every message. For example, a text message has a limit of 640 characters. This isn't a real limitation; you can still create a text message with more characters. It serves as an indication based on what Facebook Messenger will accept. So if you're using Messenger, it's a good idea to observe the character limit; otherwise your messages won't be posted in the user's conversation.
"
How can I add a message delay?,"You can add a delay of up to 5 seconds between each message in a group of messages.

The main reason for adding a delay is so that users have enough time to read the message before your bot sends the next one. In a chat interface, this is especially important because each new message moves the previous message up. Also, dropping several messages with no delay can feel a little â€¦ robotic! Another important reason for adding a delay is to give your bot personality. For example, you might want to add a short delay to make it look as though your bot is thinking! But be careful not to make your delays too long, so that users aren't waiting unnecessarily."
How do I delete my bot? ,"From within your bot, click on the settings button on the top right. Navigate to the ""Danger Zone"". Once in the danger zone select ""Delete bot"". "
How do I test my chatbot? ,"To test your chatbot navigate to the ""Chat with your bot"" bubble on the bottom right of your screen. From there, you can type in input as a user would and see the replies the bot would send. "
How do I change the matching strictness of my bot? ,"From within your bot, click on the settings button on the top right. Go to the bottom of the page where it says ""NLP"". Navigate to the ""Matching Strictness"" component. From there you will be able to configure a number between 0 to 100. The closer to 100 the more difficult it is for an intent to get triggered. "
How do I enable pronoun resolution? ,"From within your bot, click on the settings button on the top right. Go to the bottom of the page where it says ""NLP"". Navigate to the context management area and then click the box that says ""Resolve Pronouns"". "
What is pronoun resolution?,"Pronoun resolution allows you to map pronouns to their entities in the conversation history. It is off my default. When you turn the feature on it will automatically replace users pronouns with the words they were referring to. 
For example: My HR manager is Mike. I would like to book an appointment with him. In this case, him would be resolved to Mike. "
How do I reset the memory of my bot?,"To reset the memory of your bot follow the steps below. 
1. From within a skill, click on ""Update Conversation"". 
2. Then select ""Edit Memory"" from the drop down menu. 
3. See a checkbox in the top left corner that says ""Reset all memory"" 
4. Select that box and click save and your memory will be reset when a user finishes that action block
"
What are the standard languages?,"Our standard languages are Arabic, Catalan, Danish, Finnish, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norweigian, Dutch, Polish, Portugese, Russian, Swedish, and Chinese. If a language is standard that means that the bot has intent detection, custom entities, and language detection. "
