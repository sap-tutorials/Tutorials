[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Go to sign up page)]

First we need to create an account on the Gateway System.  The system will use your sap.com profile information to create the account.

Click this link in your browser: [Gateway Registration system](https://register.sapdevcenter.com/SUPSignForms).

> **Note:** In order to sign up for an account on the Gateway Demo System, you must have an account on **sap.com**.  To register for an account on sap.com, navigate to [http://sap.com](http://www.sap.com/index.html), and then click on the **person icon** in the upper left hand corner of the web page. Once your account is set up, you can continue to register.

Verify all of your *User Information* on the web page.   Please be certain your email address is correct.  If this address is incorrect, please fix it in your sap.com user profile.

Next, read the Terms and Conditions, and check the box next to the line *I have read and understood the Terms and Conditions.*

When ready, click the **Register** button.
