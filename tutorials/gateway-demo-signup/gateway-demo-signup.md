[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Go to sign up page)]

First we need to create an account on the Gateway System.  The system will use your sap.com profile information to create the account.

Click or enter this link in your browser: [https://supsignformsb03be6e80.us1.hana.ondemand.com/SUPSignForms/](https://supsignformsb03be6e80.us1.hana.ondemand.com/SUPSignForms/).

> **Note:** In order to sign up for an account on the Gateway Demo System, you must have an account on **sap.com**.  To register for an account on sap.com, navigate to [http://sap.com](http://go.sap.com/index.html), and then click on the **person icon** in the upper left hand corner of the web page. Once your account is set up, you can continue to register.
