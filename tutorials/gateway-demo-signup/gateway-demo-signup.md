1.  First we need to create an account on the Gateway System.  The system will use your sap.com profile information to create the account.

    Click or enter this link in your browser: [https://supsignformsb03be6e80.us1.hana.ondemand.com/SUPSignForms/](https://supsignformsb03be6e80.us1.hana.ondemand.com/SUPSignForms/).

    > **Note:** In order to sign up for an account on the Gateway Demo System, you must have an account on **sap.com**.  To register for an account on sap.com, navigate to [http://sap.com](http://go.sap.com/index.html), and then click on the **person icon** in the upper left hand corner of the web page. Once your account is set up, you can continue to register.

    You should see this page:

2.  Verify all of your *User Information* on the web page.   Please be certain your email address is correct.  If this address is incorrect, please fix it in your sap.com user profile.

	 Next, read the Terms and Conditions, and check the box next to the line *I have read and understood the Terms and Conditions.*

	 When ready, click the **Register** button.

	 The screen will change and the word *Success* will appear.

3. 	 Check your email inbox.  You will receive an email from *no-reply@sap.com* to your email account with your username and password.

    > **Note:** If you do not recieve an email, please check and make sure your email address, listed on the registration web page, is correct.  If this address is correct, please wait for 5 minutes for the email to go through.  Also, check your spam filters - this email is sometimes reported as spam.  If the address is incorrect, change it on sap.com, and then start the registration process again.

    This is an example of the registration confirmation email:

4.  Once you received your registration email, go to the [SAP Gateway WebGUI](https://sapes4.sapdevcenter.com/) (https://sapes4.sapdevcenter.com/).  Enter the username and initial password from your email.
