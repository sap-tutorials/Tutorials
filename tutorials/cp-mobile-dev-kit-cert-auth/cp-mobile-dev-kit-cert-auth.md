    >If you see a _Confirm Finish_ window, click **OK**.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Modify default OAuth security settings)]

When you configure an MDK app in Mobile Service cockpit, OAuth security is assigned to the app by default.

To enable certificate based authentication, you need to modify **Redirect URL** in **Security** configuration.

1. Click **Security**.

    !![MDK](img-2.1.png)

2. Click **pencil** icon to make changes to default configuration.

    !![MDK](img-2.2.png)

3. Replace the *Redirect URL* with `mdkclient://oauth2redirect` parameter, and click **OK** to save the changes. This *Redirect URL* needs to be added in the `AllowedDomains` property while building your branded client (step 3.5).

    !![MDK](img-2.3.png)

    >`mdkclient` is an URL scheme for your branded MDK client, you will use this value in step 3.3.

    >`oauth2redirect` is just a random path. It could be any value.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Create your .mdkproject folder)]

>Make sure you are choosing the right development platform tab above.

Make sure that you have already completed steps 1 & 2 from [this](cp-mobile-dev-kit-build-client) tutorial.

[OPTION BEGIN [Mac]]

1. In the `MDKClient_SDK` folder, you will find the `template.mdkproject` folder.

    !![MDK](img-3.1.png)

    It is recommended that you copy this folder to another location so that you can to use it for future builds. Copy and paste it anywhere, and then rename the template to `MDKCertApp.mdkproject`.

    !![MDK](img-3.1.1.png)

2. Next, you will need to update the `BrandedSettings.json` and `MDKProject.json` files as needed for your client. Go into the `MDKCertApp.mdkproject` folder.

    !![MDK](img-3.2.png)

3. Open the `MDKProject.json` file and update it as needed. This file has some build-time configurations such as the application name, version and bundle ID.

    !![MDK](img-3.3.png)

    >`AppName`: Provide a name for example: `MDKCertApp`. It is the name of the application on the home screen of the device and it is also be the name of the folder where the client is created.

    >`BundleID`: It should be a unique identifier for your application.  This controls if the client can be installed side by side with other applications on the device.  Two applications with the same Bundle ID cannot be installed at the same time on a device.  For iOS this is the Identifier `(AppID)` that is registered in Apple Developer account since that determines if the application can be installed alongside other applications. If the `XCode` project is set up to use _Automatically manage signing_ then when building, `XCode` will automatically generate a signing profile for the specified bundle id. Without matching them, trying to run the custom client in iOS device will result in failure. In Android, it is known as [application ID](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id).

    >`URLScheme`: Allows you to specify a custom URL scheme which opens the client. This value is provided in step 2 for **Redirect URL**.
     If the URL includes connection settings as URL parameters, these settings will override the ones used by the client. The default is `mdkclient`. This value needs to match the value provided in step 2 for the Redirect URL. This value also needs to be unique across applications on your device.  If the value is not unique the wrong application may be referenced when redirecting.      

4. Open the `BrandedSettings.json` file and update the `ConnectionSettings` with the values for your MDK application in Mobile Services. You also need to add the `"AllowCerts":true` property into the `ConnectionSettings` block.

    !![MDK](img-3.4.png)

    >`AllowCerts` property allows MDK client to use the certificate. You can find more information about this property in [help](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/getting-started/mdk/custom-client/branding-custom-client.html#allow-certs) documentation. To access the certificate on the device during on-boarding if requested by the Identity provider (IdP).

    To find the correct URLs for your client, you should navigate to  [Mobile Services cockpit](cp-mobile-dev-kit-ms-setup) and find your MDK application that you want to link to this client.


5. Click `com.sap.mdk.certs` > **Security** tab.

    Copy the Client ID, Redirect URL, OAuth Authorisation & OAuth Token and paste to `ClientId`, `RedirectUrl`, `AuthorizationEndPointUrl` and `TokenUrl` parameters respectively.

    !![MDK](img-3.5.png)

6. `AppId`: App ID from `Info` tab.

    !![MDK](img-3.6.png)

7. `ServerUrl`: Server URL from `APIs` tab.

    !![MDK](img-3.7.png)   

8. Add `mdkclient://oauth2redirect` in the `AllowedDomains` property.

    !![MDK](img-3.8.1.png)

    >If you are connecting to `AliCloud` accounts, you will also need to add your custom domains underÂ the same `AllowedDomains` property. You can find more details in [documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/getting-started/mdk/custom-client/branding-custom-client.html#connection-settings-allowlist).     

9. In the last section of `BrandedSettings.json` file, make these changes:

    | Field | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `DetailLabelViewText` | `Branded client that can on-board using certificates for authentication` |
    | `SigninButtonText` | `Start` |

    !![MDK](img-3.8.png)
