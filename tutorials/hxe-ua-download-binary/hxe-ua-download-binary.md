<!-- loio605bef28cbed45a58c53d00c2c1375a1 -->

## Prerequisites
Close the Download Manager if it is running in GUI mode.


## You will learn
You will learn how to download the binary image of SAP HANA 2.0, express edition and optional additional components.

---

## Intro
> Note:
> The Download Manager for Windows (`HXEDownloadManager_win.exe`) runs in asynchronous mode, and console mode is not available. If you are a Windows user, download the platform-independent Download Manager (`HXEDownloadManager.jar`) to use console mode.
> 
> 

### Open a command prompt


Open a command prompt at the location where you saved the Download Manager file (`HXEDownloadManager.jar` or `HXEDownloadManager_linux.bin`).

> Note:
> If you've already installed SAP HANA express edition, you can run the built-in download manager from any directory as the <sid>`adm` user.
> 
> 


### Display the command help using the `-h` argument


Linux `x86_64` Download Manager example:

```bash
HXEDownloadManager_linux.bin -h
```

Platform-independent Download Manager example:

```bash
java -jar HXEDownloadManager.jar -h
```

> Note:
> You must include an argument with each command. If you call the Download Manager without an argument, it opens in GUI mode.
> 
>
