[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Get SAP OData Connector)]

The [SAP OData Connector](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/74525/Mendix/SAP-OData-Connector) is available for download from the Mendix App Store.

The **Fiori Blank** template you are using already contains this connector, locate it in your project's App Store modules.
For more information, see [How to Use App Store Content in the Modeler](https://docs.mendix.com/community/app-store/use-app-store-content-in-the-modeler).

![Mendix App Store](mendix-salesorders1.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create GWSAMPLE_BASIC service module)]

The **SAP OData Model Creator** is a web site where your OData service metadata is transformed into a Mendix domain model that can be imported into your project.

You can generate this domain model by providing your service metadata as a file, URL, or select a service from SAP API Business Hub.

![OData Model Creator](mendix-salesorders1a.png)

We will do it by providing a file.
This file can be downloaded from the OData service URL directly using the `$metadata` suffix or retrieved from SAP Gateway. Since we're using the SAP Demo Gateway System (ES5) for this tutorial, the metadata file can be found at:

```
https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/$metadata
```

To generate the service module, follow these steps:

1. Save the metadata file to your hard drive.

2. Open the SAP [OData Model Creator](https://sapodatamodelcreator.mendixcloud.com/).

3. Select the **Manual** option.

4. Upload the OData metadata XML file and click **Continue**:

    ![Domain Model Creator](mendix-salesorders2.png)

5. Select the Schema and click **Continue**.

    ![Domain Model Creator Schema](mendix-salesorders2a.png)

6. Press **`Generate`** **`.mpk`**. A progress bar will be shown during the parsing and generation of the module.

7. Once the generation is done, the **Download** button appears. Notice that the file name of your module is extracted from the metadata file itself.

    Press **Download** and save the `.mpk` file locally.

    ![Domain Model Creator](mendix-salesorders3.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Import module in Mendix app)]

Now you have a Mendix module ready to be imported into your project.

1. Open the project that you created, right-click the project root folder, select **Import module package…** and select the `.mpk` file.

    ![Import module package](mendix-salesorders4.png) <br>

    You now have your `GWSAMPLE_BASIC` module available in your project ready to use in combination with the SAP OData Connector.

    ![Import module package](mendix-salesorders5.png)

2. Open the generated domain model and explore the entities and associations. Imagine that you had to create that manually -- **a lot of work!**

    ![Generated Domain Model](mendix-salesorders6.png)

3. In addition to the domain model, the OData Model Creator also created two other items:
    * A constant with the name of the service, containing the service root URL
    * An enumeration (`EntitySetNames`) containing a list of all the entity sets in the model

    ![Generated Domain Model](mendix-salesorders33.png)

[VALIDATE_3]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Create constants for ES5 credentials)]

Now that we have our domain model in place, it's time to implement the connectivity to the SAP Gateway Demo System (ES5).

Our tutorial uses basic authentication to connect to the ES5 system, so let's store the username and password in constants.

1. Right-click **`MyFirstModule`** and add a new folder called **`Constants`**.

2. Right-click the **`Constants`** folder and add a new constant called **`ES5Username`**.

    ![Add Constant](mendix-salesorders7.png)

3. Enter your ES5 username as **Default value**.

    ![Add Constant](mendix-salesorders8.png)

4. Following the same steps, add a new constant and name it **`ES5Password`**.

5. Enter your ES5 password as **`Default value`**.

    ![Add Constant](mendix-salesorders9.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Add logic to get sales orders – authentication)]

Follow these steps to create the logic to get the sales orders.

1. Right-click **`MyFirstModule`** and add a new microflow, name it **`ACT_GetSalesOrders`**.

2. Right-click the line between the green and red dots in the microflow editor and select **Insert** | **Activity** (or drag and drop an activity from the upper toolbar).

3. Double-click the new activity and scroll down to locate the SAP OData Connector actions.

4. Select **`Create`** **`Request`** **`Params`**, and then click **Select**.

5. Name the variable **`RequestParams`**. This variable (as its name suggests) will hold the request parameters, and it's required for the **Add basic authentication** activity.

    ![Create Request Params](mendix-salesorders10.png)

6. Following the same steps, add an **Add basic authentication** activity.

7. Select the **`$RequestParams`** variable in the **Request parameters** dropdown.

8. Click **Edit...** for the **Username** and select the **`ES5Username`** constant by entering the following argument: `@MyFirstModule.ES5Username`

    ![Add Basic Authentication](mendix-salesorders12.png)

9. Follow the same steps for the **Password**.

10. Change the output **Variable** name to **Authentication**.

11. Click **OK** to close the dialog.

![Add Basic Authentication](mendix-salesorders13.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Add logic to get sales orders – request)]

1. Add another activity to the microflow and select the **Get List** action from the SAP OData Connector.
The **Get List** action retrieves a list of entities described in the domain model. In our case we will retrieve a list of sales orders.

2. Fill in the required fields of the **Get List** action. For this tutorial, use the following settings:

**Input Values**

    | Field | Value |
    |:-------|:-------|
    | Response type | The type you want to query from the OData service. Select the `SalesOrder` entity. |
    | Destination | empty |
    | Query  | The URL to which you want to execute your request. In our case:<br><br> `https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/SalesOrderSet` <br><br> And it's constructed by entering the following code:<br><br> `@GWSAMPLE_BASIC.GWSAMPLE_BASIC + '/' + toString(GWSAMPLE_BASIC.EntitySetNames.SalesOrderSet)` |
    | Request&nbsp;parameters | `$RequestParams` variable |
    | Parent |empty|
    | Parent association name |empty|
    | Result info |empty|
    | Use&nbsp;Cloud&nbsp;Connector | `false` |

**Output Values**

    | Field | Value |
    |:-------|:-------|
    | Return type | List of GWSAMPLE_BASIC.SalesOrder |
    | Use return value | `Yes` |
    | List Name | `SalesOrders` |

    > In our case, the `Use cloud connector` is set to `false` because ES5 is a publicly accessible system. <br>
    > If you would like to consume a service from your on-premise back-end system, you need to setup and configure the SAP Cloud Connector and then mark this field as `true`. <br>
    > When running the Mendix application on SAP BTP, the SAP Cloud Connector will automatically be utilized to gain access to your on-premise system. <br>
    > For more information, see the [SAP Cloud Connector](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html) documentation.


3. Click **OK** to close the dialog.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Add logic to get sales orders – return value)]

In the microflow, make the return value of the microflow a **`List`** of **`SalesOrders`** so you can call the microflow as a data source in a page.

  1. Double-click the **`End-Event`** (red dot).

  2. Select **`List`** for the **Type**.

  3. Select **`SalesOrder`** for the **Entity**.

  4. Click on **Generate…** and select the **`SalesOrders`** variable.

      ![Expression value](mendix-salesorders15.png)

  5. Verify the **End Event** dialog matches the following:

      ![End Event](mendix-salesorders16.png)

  6. Click **OK** to close the dialog.

Your microflow should look like the following:
