## Prerequisites  
- **Tutorials:** [Enable the SAP Integration Suite, API Management capability](cp-starter-isuite-onboard-subscribe)

- **Tutorials:** [Create an Account on the Gateway Demo System](gateway-demo-signup)

## Details
### You will learn  
- Create an API provider system

SAP Integration Suite, API Management uses three main components to expose APIs.

- The API Provider is used to abstract the connection to the backend / target system
- The API Proxy is the actual API which contains the logic to connect to the target system. Here you can model the flow, add security policies, transform the incoming message or look for content injections
- The API Product which bundles one or more API Proxies before they are exposed in the API Developer portal so they can be consumed by a developer

You will use SAP Integration Suite, API Management to create an API Provider. This API Provider will connect to a backend system, in your case to the SAP Gateway Developer System. In a real-life scenario the API Provider could connect to your Developer System. Once you have created and tested an API Proxy on it, you would transport the proxy to your productive system and the underlying API Provider would now point to your productive backend system.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Learn about the API Management tools)]


In the next couple tutorials that are part of this series, you will take a look at the different tools that API Management provides. [Get an overview of the tooling](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/06/20/part-2-overview-of-sap-api-management-tools/) and how each component works together to help create your proxy.

Your proxy is what you expose to the outside world so they can consume your API. Review the blog to learn about the different building blocks of a proxy and how the tools SAP provided through API Management make it easier for you as a developer.
