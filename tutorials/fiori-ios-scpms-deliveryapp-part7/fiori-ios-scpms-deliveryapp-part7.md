[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Display User Registrations)]

> **NOTE:** You will only see entries under **User Registration** if you have deployed your application on a physical device. Running an application from the iOS Simulator will not result in an entry showing up.

.

Click the **User Registration** link. Depending on whether you have deployed your application to your physical device, you will see the registered users for each application:

In this view, you can specify specific client log levels per registration, as well as removing existing registrations.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Display Users By Application)]

In the left pane, click the **Server Data Report** link, and from the filter, select **Users (by Application)**.

You should now see the active users per application:

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Display Request statistics)]

From the filter, select **Requests** for **Last 7 Days**

You should now see the total number of requests in the last 7 days:

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Display Response Time statistics)]

From the filter, select **Response Time** for **Last 7 Days**

You should now see the response times in the last 7 days, split by **Mobile Response Time**, **Authentication Response Time** and **Backend Response Time**:

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Display Offline Requests statistics)]

From the filter, select **Offline Requests** for **Last 7 Days**

You should now see the total number of Offline requests in the last 7 days, split by **Initial Downloads requests** and **Refresh requests**:

![Display User Registrations](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part7-05.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Display Offline Response Time statistics)]

From the filter, select **Offline Response Time** for **Last 7 Days**

You should now see the total number of Offline requests in the last 7 days, split by **Initial Downloads Response Time** and **Refresh Response Time**:

![Display User Registrations](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part7-06.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Display Outbound Traffic statistics)]

From the filter, select **Outbound Traffic (by Application)** for **Last 4 weeks**

You should now see the total number of bytes sent in the last 4 weeks:

![Display User Registrations](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part7-07.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 9: ](Display Application specific statistics)]

While the mentioned statistics are great, they are mostly aggregated of all apps running on top of SAP Cloud Platform mobile service for development and operations. A much practical scenario is to display statistics for just one single app.

Navigate to **Mobile Application > Native/Hybrid > My Deliveries**. In the tab bar, click the **Usage Statistics** link. Set the **Time frame for Usage Analytics** to `Last 7 Days` :

![Display User Registrations](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part7-09.png)

If you scroll down a bit, you see the **Request** and **Response Time** statistics:

![Display User Registrations](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part7-10.png)

...and the **Offline Requests** and **Offline Response Times**:

![Display User Registrations](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part7-11.png)

And here you see why displaying the statistics for one single app can be practical: for example, the **Offline Requests** shows you the initial requests and refresh requests **for all Entities** in your OData service!
