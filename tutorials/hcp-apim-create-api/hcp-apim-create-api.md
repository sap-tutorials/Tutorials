# Create an API Proxy
<!-- description --> Learn how SAP Integration Suite, API Management can leverage the OData catalog service to retrieve relevant information from a SAP Gateway system and pre-populate required information for an API proxy.

## Prerequisites  
- **Tutorials:**  [Create an API Provider System](hcp-apim-create-provider)

## You will learn  
SAP Integration Suite, API Management uses three main components to expose APIs.
- The API Provider is used to abstract the connection to the backend / target system
- The API Proxy is the actual API which contains the logic to connect to the target system. Here you can model the flow, add security policies, transform the incoming message or look for content injections
- The API Product which bundles one or more API Proxies before they are exposed in the API Business Hub Enterprise so they can be consumed by a developer

## Intro
In this tutorial you will learn how to create an API Proxy based on the API Provider created in the previous step. You will learn how SAP Integration Suite, API Management can leverage the OData catalog service to retrieve relevant information from a SAP Gateway system and pre-populate required information for the API Proxy
