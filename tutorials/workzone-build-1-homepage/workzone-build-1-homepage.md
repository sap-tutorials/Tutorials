# Design SAP Work Zone's Home Page
<!-- description --> Open the Home page, add content to it, and change the overall layout.

## Prerequisites
A subaccount in SAP BTP that includes a subscription to the SAP Work Zone service has already been setup for you.
&nbsp;
**Note that SAP Work Zone is not available in a trial account.**

## You will learn
  - How to open SAP Work Zone
  - How to design a SAP Work Zone **Home** page


## Intro
In this group of tutorials you'll learn how to build a digital workplace solution using SAP Work Zone.

The **Home** page is the landing page when you first open SAP Work Zone. It is the first menu item in the top navigation bar.

In this tutorial, you'll be designing a SAP Work Zone **Home** page. You'll add rows and columns to configure its layout and also add widgets with static content to it. In later tutorials, you'll add apps and cards to this page.

>Note that you can also design the overview page of a workspace the same way.

### Download resources that you'll be using for this tutorial


First download these image files so that they're on your computer ready for you to add to your page:

- [`home_row1_rotating_banner1.png`](Home_Page_Images/home_row1_rotating_banner1.jpg)
- [`home_row1_rotating_banner2.png`](Home_Page_Images/home_row1_rotating_banner2.jpg)
- [`home_row3_image1.png`](Home_Page_Images/home_row3_image1.jpg)
- [`home_row3_image2.png`](Home_Page_Images/home_row3_image2.jpg)




### Access SAP Work Zone



1. Open your browser and navigate to your subaccount in SAP BTP.

2. Click **Instances & Subscriptions** in the left navigation panel.

    <!-- border -->![Click Instances & Subscriptions](1-click-instances-subscriptions.png)

3. Under the **Subscriptions** tab, click **SAP Work Zone**.

    <!-- border -->![Open SAP Work Zone](2-open-work-zone.png)

4. Enter your log on credentials.

    When you open SAP Work Zone, you'll see the runtime of the company's work zone with the **Home** page in focus. By default, SAP Work Zone is preconfigured with a shell with different content and features. You can configure SAP Work Zone and add your own content.

    <!-- border -->![Open work zone](3-default-home-page.png)


>SAP Work Zone includes the following menu items:<div>&nbsp;</div><div> **Home** - displays information that is relevant to everyone in the company who has access to the work zone.<div>&nbsp;</div><div> **My Workspace** - a personal workspace. All users of SAP Work Zone can create their own workspace. This workspace can be used as a favorite page for frequently used content and applications.<div>&nbsp;</div><div> **Applications** - provides access to all business apps that the logged on user can access and that are configured for display.<div>&nbsp;</div><div> **Workspaces** - a central place for you to create workspaces. These workspaces can become available to any group of company users and to external users.<div>&nbsp;</div><div> **Tools** - provides access to different tools like company knowledge base, calendar, and more.

>&nbsp;


In the next steps, you'll learn how to design the **Home** page of the company `Velotics`.




### Open the Page Designer of the Home page


The Page Designer tool is used to edit the **Home** page and also to edit overview pages of any workspace in SAP Work Zone. In this step, you'll access the page designer for the **Home** page.

You can use the Page Designer to add, move, resize, align, configure widgets, and modify the overall layout of your page. As you design a page, your work is automatically saved so that you don't lose your changes prior to publishing or saving as a draft.

1. With the **Home** page in focus, select the **Switch page view** icon on the left side of the screen.

    <!-- border -->![Switch page view](4-switch-page-view.png)

2.  In the dialog box that opens, click **Company**.

    <!-- border -->![Click company view](5-select-company.png)

3. Click **+** to add a page tab.

    <!-- border -->![Add a page tab](6-add-page-tab.png)

4. Name the page tab **Home** and click **Create**.

    <!-- border -->![Name the page tab](7-name-page-tab.png)

5. This opens the **Page Designer Tips** screen. You can close it for now.

The Page Designer is now active and you can use it to design your **Home** page.

> Note that the **Home** page can also be designed and managed from the **Administration Console** â€“ a tool where all administration tasks are performed for SAP Work Zone. You can get to the Administration Console, by following these steps:
>
>1. Under your avatar at the top right of the screen, open the dropdown menu, and click **Administration Console**.
>2. From the **Administration Console**, expand the **Area & Workspace Configuration** menu item and click **Home Page**.
>3. Click **Manage Home Page** to open the home page.




### Add a header with a title for the Home page
