[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Add SAP HANA client and configuration to your project)]
1. Add SAP HANA support to your project by running.

    ```Shell/Bash
    cds add hana
    ```

    This adds the `hdb` module for SAP HANA access to your `package.json` file and will configure kind `sql` as the database service.

    Changes in the `package.json` file done by `cds add hana`:

    <!-- cpes-file package.json:$.cds -->
    ```JSON[4-13]
    {
        "name": "cpapp",
        ...
        "cds": {
        "requires": {
            "db": {
            "kind": "sql"
            }
        },
        "hana": {
            "deploy-format": "hdbtable"
        }
        }
    }
    ```

    Different to CAP default behavior, kind `sql` uses the SQLite in-memory database for local testing and the SAP HANA database for productive usage in the cloud.

    The `deploy-format` setting is required to create the required artifacts for SAP HANA Cloud in the build which are different from the artifacts for the previous SAP HANA offering.

    > - [Using Databases](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/databases#get-hana)
    > - [CAP Configuration](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-env)

2. Run `cds watch` in your project folder and check that your app still works locally as it used to work before at <http://localhost:4004/>.

SAP HANA Cloud service instances are not created automatically for any type of account. Therefore, you will have to create a SAP HANA Cloud service instance first, if you don't have one yet.

If you already have an SAP HANA Cloud service instance in your Cloud Foundry space **&rarr;** continue with **Use an Existing SAP HANA Cloud service instance**.

If you need to create a SAP HANA Cloud service instance first **&rarr;** continue with **Create an SAP HANA Cloud service instance**.
