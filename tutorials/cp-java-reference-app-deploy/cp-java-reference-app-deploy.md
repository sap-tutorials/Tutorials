[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Clone the Git repository)]
In this step you will create a git repository in the Eclipse IDE and copy the repository of the ESPM application.

1. Copy the repository URL.

    - In your browser, go to <https://github.com/SAP/cloud-espm-v2>.

    - Choose **Clone or Download**, and copy the URL. You can click ![Git-Clone-or-Download](Git_Clone.png) ( **Copy to clipboard** ).

2. Clone the Git repository in Eclipse.

    - In Eclipse, select **Window** > **Perspective** > **Open Perspective** > **Other**.

    - Select **Git** and click **OK** to open the **Git** perspective.

    - From the **Git Repositories** view on the left select **Clone a Git repository**.

        As you already copied the `cloud-espm-v2` Git repository URL to your clipboard, the URI, Host, Repository path and Protocol fields are automatically filled.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Import and build the Maven project)]

The following steps describe how you can import and then update the Maven project (which fixes any Maven and POM dependency-related issues). Then you will build the Maven project in Eclipse.

1. Import and update the Maven project

    - In Eclipse, switch back to the **Java EE** perspective and go to **File > Import**.

    - From the Import box that appears select **Maven > Existing Maven projects** and choose **Next**.

    - Specify the root directory of the application (usually Git stores its information in your user folder, then a folder named "git" and then under a folder with the application name), then choose **Finish**.

    - To update the dependencies right click on the **`espm` project > Maven > Update Project** and choose **OK** from the box that appears.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Add the Retailer role)]
