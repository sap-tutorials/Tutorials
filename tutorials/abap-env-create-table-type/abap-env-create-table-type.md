# Create an ABAP Table Type
<!-- description --> Create a table type and use it to retrieve data from a database table.

## Prerequisites
- You have done one of the following:
    - You have a valid instance of SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) ABAP Environment. For more information, see **Tutorial**: [Create Your First ABAP Console Application](abap-environment-console-application), steps 1-2
    - You have a valid instance of an on-premise AS ABAP server, version 7.52 or higher. (The text-based Table Editor is not available for earlier ABAP server versions). For a free AS ABAP server, 7.52, SP04, see [SAP Developers: Trials and Downloads - 7.52](https://developers.sap.com/trials-downloads.html?search=7.52)
- You have installed [ABAP Development Tools 3.0](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#abap), latest version
- You have downloaded or pulled the ABAP Flight Reference Scenario. To pull this reference scenario from `Github`, see [Downloading the ABAP Flight Reference Scenario](https://help.sap.com/viewer/923180ddb98240829d935862025004d6/Cloud/en-US/def316685ad14033b051fc4b88db07c8.html)
- **Tutorial**: [Create a Database Table](abap-dev-create-table)

## You will learn
  - How to create and edit a table type for an internal table in the new, form-based Table Types editor
  - How to use this table type to retrieve data from a database table

## Intro
Table types can also be defined in, for example, an ABAP program or class. The differences between the two approaches include:

  -	Table types in the ABAP Data Dictionary are maintained in a form-based editor, table types in ABAP in a text-based editor
  -	**Reuse**: Table types can only be used by other Dictionary types if they are defined in the Data Dictionary
  -	**Modularization**: Table types in the Dictionary are stand-alone objects, whereas table types in ABAP are always part of another Repository object

Throughout this tutorial, objects have the suffix **`XXX`**. Remember to always replace this with your initials or group number.

---

### Create a table type


1. Open your ABAP Project or ABAP Cloud Project from the previous tutorial, then open the package in which you created the database table.

2. Select your package and choose **New > Other ABAP Repository Object > Dictionary > Table Type** from the context menu.

    ![Image depicting step1-new-table-type](step1-new-table-type.png)

3. Enter a name and description and choose **Next**.

    <!-- border -->![Image depicting step1b-name](step1b-name.png)

4. Create or assign a transport request and choose **Finish**.

The table type appears in a new editor.  

<!-- border -->![Image depicting step1e-table-type-editor](step1e-table-type-editor.PNG)


### Define a type

Choose the category **Dictionary Type** For the type name, choose the database table you created in a previous tutorial, for example **`Z_BOOKING_XXX`** (replacing `XXX` with your group number or initials).

> Enter the exact name. The Browse function may not work in some environments.

<!-- border -->![Image depicting step2-define-type](step2-define-type.png)

> In the ABAP Environment, you can only work with whitelisted objects. The majority of tables you might expect, such as `SFLIGHT` are not whitelisted. For a complete list of whitelisted objects, see the folder **Released Objects**. To sort objects by object type, not package, use a Duplicate Tree

![Image depicting step2b-released-objects](step2b-released-objects.png)

> In ABAP on-premise systems, this is not an issue.


### Define a primary key

1. You cannot define your own primary key for a standard table. First, change the access type to **Sorted Table**.

    ![Image depicting step3-change-access](step3-change-access.png)

2. Change the Primary Key type to **Key Components**.

    ![Image depicting step3b-change-key-type](step3b-change-key-type.png)

3. You can now choose the key fields from a drop-down list, by choosing **Auto-complete (Ctrl+Space)**.

    <!-- border -->![Image depicting step3c-change-key-comps](step3c-change-key-comps.png)

4. Choose each key field in turn, using **Auto-complete (`Ctrl+Space`)**:

    <!-- border -->![Image depicting step3d-choose-key-comps](step3d-choose-key-comps.png)


This is for test purposes only. The access type you choose in real life affects performance. For more information, see:

  - [ABAP Keyword Documentation: Internal Tables, Selection of Table Category](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/index.htm?file=abenitab_kind.htm)

  - [ABAP Examples: Internal Tables, Key Accesses](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/index.htm?file=abenitab_kind.htm)


### Define a secondary key

Users may want to query a database table using something other than the primary key. To enable this, create a secondary key.

1. First, select **Secondary Key** and choose **Create...** from the context menu:

    ![Image depicting step4-secondary-key](step4-secondary-key.png)

2. Enter a name and choose the component(s) (or fields):

    <!-- border -->![Image depicting step4b-secondary-key-comps](step4b-secondary-key-comps.png)

The keys are listed.

  <!-- border -->![Image depicting step4c-keys-list](step4c-keys-list.png)


### Create an ABAP class

Finally, you will test your table type by using it to:

- define an internal table
- get database data into this table
- output the table content to the console

1. First create the ABAP Class, by selecting your package and choosing **New > ABAP Class** from the context menu:

    ![Image depicting step5-create-class](step5-create-class.png)

2. Enter a name **`ZCL_GET_ACCOUNT_DATA_XXX`** and description for your class (replacing `XXX` with your group number or initials).

    <!-- border -->![step5-name-class](step5-name-class.png)

3. Assign a transport request and choose **Finish**.

The class appears in a new editor.

<!-- border -->![step5c-class-editor](step5c-class-editor.png)


### Add an interface

1. Add the following interface to your class:

    ```ABAP
     interfaces if_oo_adt_classrun.
    ```

This interface provides a light-weight solution for executing an ABAP program without launching a full user interface.
It also lets you display text or data in the Console View.

2. Add the implementation for the **`main`** method of this interface by selecting the interface name and choosing **Add implementation...** from the context menu.

    <!-- border -->![step6a-add-intf](step6a-add-intf.png)


### Implement the method

You will now add the following code to the `main` method, remembering to rename the table type and database table to your own (for example, replacing `XXX` with your group number or initials)..

1. Create an internal table `lt_accounts` with the table type that you just created, `ZTT_ACCOUNTS_XXX`.

    ```ABAP
    DATA: lt_accounts type ZTT_ACCOUNTS_XXX.
    ```
2. Select data from the database table from the previous tutorial `ZTBOOKING_XXX` and add it to the internal table.

    ```ABAP
    select * from ZACCOUNTS_XXX
    into table @lt_accounts.
    ```

3. Output the internal table to the console.

    ```ABAP
    out->write( EXPORTING
    data = lt_accounts
    name = 'Accounts:' ).
    ```


4. Then save and activate your class using **`Ctrl+S, Ctrl+F3`**.


### Check your code

The complete class should look like this:

```ABAP
CLASS zcl_get_account_data_xxx DEFINITION
  PUBLIC
  FINAL
  CREATE PUBLIC .

  PUBLIC SECTION.
    INTERFACES if_oo_adt_classrun.
  PROTECTED SECTION.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS zcl_get_account_data_xxx IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD if_oo_adt_classrun~main.
    DATA: lt_accounts type ZTT_ACCOUNTS_XXX.

    select * from ZACCOUNTS_XXX
    into table @lt_accounts.

    out->write( EXPORTING
    data = lt_accounts
    name = 'Accounts:' ).

  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
```



### Test your class

Run your class in the console by choosing **`F9`**. Your output should look like this:
