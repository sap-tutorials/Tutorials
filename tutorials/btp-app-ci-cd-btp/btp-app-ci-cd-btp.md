[SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/CONTINUOUS_DELIVERY/Cloud/en-US) is a service on SAP BTP, which lets you configure and run predefined continuous integration and delivery pipelines. It connects with your Git SCM repository and builds, tests, and deploys your code changes. In its user interface, you can easily monitor the status of your builds and detect errors as soon as possible, which helps you prevent integration problems before completing your development.

SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery has a ready-to-use pipeline for CAP, that is applicable to multi-target application (MTA) and Node.js based projects. It does not require you to host your own Jenkins instance and it provides an easy, UI-guided way to configure your pipelines.

For more information on how to configure and run predefined pipelines for your own CI/CD process, have a look at [What Is SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery](https://help.sap.com/viewer/SAP-Cloud-Platform-Continuous-Integration-and-Delivery).

    !![Jobs](CICD_jobs.png)

2. For **Job Name**, enter a freely chosen name for your job, which is unique in your SAP BTP subaccount, for example **`RiskApplication`**.

3. Under **Repository**, choose **Add Repository**.

    !![Add repository](CICD_add_repository1.png)

4. Add the name and the URL for your repository.

    !![Add repository](CICD_add_repository2.png)

    > If your GitHub repository is private, enter the name of the GitHub credentials (`github` as created in step [Configure you GitHub credentials](#configure-your-github-credentials) above) in **Repository Credentials** to access your GitHub Repository that you have already created. If your GitHub repository isn't private, leave this field empty.

5. Choose **Add**.

6. For **Branch**, enter the GitHub branch of your repository from which you want to receive push events. In this example, **`main`**.

7. As **Pipeline**, choose **SAP Cloud Application Programming Model**.

11. For **Build Tool Version**, select the latest version.

11. Leave the execution of the **Maven Static Code Checks** step switched off.

12. Leave the execution of the **Lint Check** step switched off.

    !![CAP Job](CICD_CAP_job.png)

13. Leave the execution of the **Additional Unit Tests** switched off.

14. Leave **Acceptance** switched off.

15. Leave **`SonarQube` Scan** under **Compliance** switched off.

14. Under the **Release** section, switch the execution of the **Deploy to Cloud Foundry Space** step on.

    !![CAP Job](CICD_CAP_job_stages.png)

16. Replace the placeholders `<YOUR ORG NAME>`, `<YOUR SPACE NAME>`, and `<YOUR CLOUD FOUNDRY ENDPOINT>` with the values of the space in the Cloud Foundry environment to which you want to deploy. You can get the values from your subaccount overview in the SAP BTP cockpit.

    !![Cockpit](CP_API_Endpoint.png)

17. For **Deploy Type**, choose `standard`.

17. For **Credentials**, choose the name of the credentials you created before in step [Configure your SAP BTP credentials](#configure-your-sap-btp-credentials). In the example we used `cfdeploy`.

    > Use a technical user instead of your personal credentials.

    > Deployment will not work if you have activated Two-factor authentication for the user.

17. Leave the **Upload to Cloud Transport Management** step switched off.

18. Choose **Create**.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Create a GitHub webhook)]
GitHub webhooks allow you to automate CI/CD builds. Whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository, a webhook push event is sent to the service to trigger a build of the connected job.

To create a webhook in GitHub, you need some data that has been automatically created during the previous step. You can find this data, the *Payload URL* and *Secret*, when you open the detail view of an existing repository in the **Repositories** tab.

1. Choose the name of your repository and choose **Webhook Data**.

    !![Webhook](CICD_WebHookRepo.png)

    You will see a popup like this:

    !![Webhook](CICD_webhook.png)

2. In your project in GitHub, go to the **Settings** tab.

3. From the navigation pane, choose **Webhooks**.

4. Choose **Add webhook**.

    !![Webhook](GH_webhook.png)

5. Enter the **Payload URL**, **Content type**, and **Secret** from the **Webhook Data** in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. For all other settings, leave the default values.

6. Choose **Add webhook**.

    !![Webhook Details](GH_webhook_details.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]
---
[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Verify the success of your build)]
You have to trigger your job manually the first time after creation.

1. In the **Jobs** tab in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, select your job and choose **Trigger Build**.

    !![Trigger Job](CICD_trigger_job.png)

    Verify that a new tile appears in the **Builds** view. This tile should be marked as running.

    !![Job](CICD_running_job.png)

    > If you would like to check whether the job is triggered automatically after new changes, you can make a simple change in the code and verify if it's built. You can also add a time trigger for your job under section **Timed Triggers**.

2. Wait until the job has finished and verify that the build tile is marked as successful.

    !![Successful Build](CICD_successful_build.png)

    > In case you get any errors:

    > - Verify that your SAP HANA Cloud service instance is running. Your SAP HANA Cloud service instance will be automatically stopped overnight, according to the server region time zone. That means you need to restart your instance every day, before you start working with your trial.

    > - Verify you have added all necessary entitlements to your account as specified in [Prepare for SAP BTP Development](btp-app-prepare-btp).

    > While `Allow only BTP IP addresses` should be chosen for productive use, local access can be helpful for development scenarios. Therefore, you can add the CIDR codes for your SAP offices. See section [Public Office Network IP Addresses](https://nip.wdf.sap.corp/nip2/faces/networking/wan/PublicAddresses.xhtml) for more details.

    > !![Create SAP HANA Cloud: Step 5](hana_cloud_create_5.png)

3. Navigate to your space in the SAP BTP cockpit and check the list of installed applications. Now, you have a **cpapp-db-deployer** application and a **cpapp-srv** application.

    !![Applications](CICD_cpapp_applications.png)

4. Choose the **cpapp-srv** application and launch it with the application route.

    !![Cpapp Srv Route](CICD_cpapp_srv_route.png)

You have now successfully created a CI/CD pipeline and deployed your application to SAP BTP.

> Additional Information:

> If you'd like to add more stages to your job, for example, additional unit tests, you can configure the job in your repository instead of using the job editor of the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Configure an SAP Cloud Application Programming Model Job in Your Repository](https://help.sap.com/docs/CONTINUOUS_DELIVERY/99c72101f7ee40d0b2deb4df72ba1ad3/bfe48a4b12ed41868f92fa564829f752.html?locale=en-US) for more details.

> In case this is your first deployment of the `cpapp` project to the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment, please continue with the tutorial [Prepare SAP Build Work Zone, Standard Edition Setup](btp-app-work-zone-setup).  You will need to complete the configuration before you can use the application, because this part can't be automated with CI/CD tooling.
