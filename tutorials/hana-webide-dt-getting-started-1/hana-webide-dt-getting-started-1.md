### Create the TPCH user

We will begin by creating a new user which we will use throughout the tutorial. To do so, we must use HANA Cockpit. Login to HANA Cockpit, click the **Resources** link at the top, and select the appropriate resource, which should be a SAP HANA Tenant Database.

![1.1](assets/hana-webide-dt-getting-started-2-df948257.png)

Scroll to the **User and Role Management** section, and click the **Manage Users** link.

![1.2](assets/hana-webide-dt-getting-started-1-90defe78.jpg)

At the bottom left, click the blue "+" button and select **Create User**.

![1.3](assets/hana-webide-dt-getting-started-2-c9efff52.png)

In the new window, enter `TPCH` as the username, and select **password** for *Authentication Mechanism*, and type in a password. The password requirement is at least one capital letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit. Select **No** for *Force password change on next login* and keep the other options as default.

> Remember the password as you will need it to login as the TPCH user.

Click the **Save** button at the bottom-right to add the user.


### Assign roles and privileges to the TPCH user

Once the TPCH user is created, you will be redirected to a screen featuring this new user. Under **Authorization Mode**, click **Assign Roles**.

![1.5](assets/hana-webide-dt-getting-started-2-0cf7e605.png)

Click **Edit**, followed by **add** on the new window. Here, you can assign roles to the TPCH user. Search and assign **all** the following roles by clicking the checkbox beside them. Hit **OK** when you are done.
* `AFLPM_CREATOR_ERASER_EXECUTE`
* `CONTENT_ADMIN`
* `MODELING`
* `sap.hana.uis.db::SITE_DESIGNER`
* `sap.hana.uis.db::SITE_USER`

![1.6](assets/hana-webide-dt-getting-started-2-ce0c54f4.png)

Confirm you have added all the roles, and hit **Save** followed by the back arrow.

![1.7](assets/hana-webide-dt-getting-started-1-a69b11e2.jpg)

Next, we will add the required privileges by clicking the **Assign Privileges** link under the **Authorization Mode** heading (same as before).

![1.8](assets/hana-webide-dt-getting-started-1-753234fe.jpg)

Follow the same steps as you did for assigning roles, and assign **all** of the following privileges:
* `EXTENDED STORAGE ADMIN`
* `IMPORT`
* `CATALOG READ`


### Additional information

We will use this `TPCH` user through the tutorial. In the following tutorial, we will create extended storage to get started with dynamic tiering.
