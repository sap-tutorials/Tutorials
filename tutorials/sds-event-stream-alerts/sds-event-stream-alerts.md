# Generate Alerts Using a Derived Window in SAP HANA Streaming Analytics
<!-- description --> Create and use a derived window to analyze events, filter data, and generate alerts.

## Prerequisites
 - **Tutorials:** [Create a Moving Average on an Event Stream using an Aggregation Window](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/sds-event-stream-moving-average.html)

## Next Steps
- **Tutorials:** [Using the Streaming Playback tool to Test a Streaming Project](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/sds-event-stream-playback.html)

## You will learn  
 - How to use a derived window to apply a filter to watch for events that should generate an alert

---

## Intro
In this tutorial, you will add and configure a derived stream that will watch for events that need to generate an alert - by applying a filter.

However, rather than just using the standard **Filter** element, you will use the **Derived Window** element from the **Palette** since it gives you more flexibility. With this, you can apply the filter and also change the structure of the output event.

At this point in the tutorial series, if you don't want to go through the process of creating this window using the visual editor, then you can simply switch to the CCL editor ( **F6** ) and paste the CCL below into your project. From there, you can then skip to the last step to compile and test your project.

```SQL

CREATE OUTPUT WINDOW ALARM_TEMP
PRIMARY KEY DEDUCED
KEEP ALL
AS SELECT
  AVG_TEMP.MACHINEID MACHINEID ,
  AVG_TEMP.EVENT_TIME EVENT_TIME ,
  AVG_TEMP.AVG_TEMP AVG_TEMP ,
  AVG_TEMP.MAX_TEMP MAX_TEMP ,
  AVG_TEMP.LOCATION LOCATION ,
  'TEMPERATURE' ALARM_TYPE ,
  'Machine not maintaining' ALARM_DESC
FROM AVG_TEMP
WHERE AVG_TEMP.AVG_TEMP > AVG_TEMP.MAX_TEMP ;

```

### Add a derived window to generate alerts


Click on **Derived Window** in the **Palette** and drop it onto the canvas.

### Connect the new window to the event stream


Add a connector from **`AVG_TEMP`** to the new window.

![add connector](2-addconnector.png)



### Change the window name


Change the new window name to `ALARM_TEMP`, then press **Enter**.

![rename to alarm temp](3-renametoalarmtemp.png)


### Add columns to the window


Click the **Add Column Expression** ( **f(x)** ) option shown below.

![add column expression](4-addcolumnexp.png)

Choose **Copy Columns from Input** from the menu to open the column selection dialog.

![copy columns from input](5-copycolumnsfrominput.png)

Select all except for **`MIN_TEMP`** and **`TEMP_UNIT`**, then click **OK**.

![select columns](6-selectcolumns.png)

Select the **Add Column Expression** ( **f(x)** ) option, then **Column Expression** to add a column to this window.

Repeat this step to add a second column.


### Edit the column names and expressions


Rename the first new column to `ALARM_TYPE`, then press **Enter**.

![rename expression](8-renameexpression.png)

Rename the second new column to `ALARM_DESC`.

![name expression](9-nameexpression.png)

Double-click on **`simpleResultExpression6`** to edit the expression.

![edit expression](10-editexpression.png)

Enter `'TEMPERATURE'` in the expression edit box for the **`ALARM_TYPE`** column. This will set the "type" of all alarms emitted by this window to the string "TEMPERATURE". Press **Enter** to confirm your entry.

> Note that it's important to enclose string values in single quotes in expressions.

Enter `'Machine not maintaining temperature'` in the expression edit box for the **`ALARM_DESC`** column. Press **Enter** to confirm your entry.

### Add a filter expression


Now click the **Add Query Clause** button.

![add query](13-addquery.png)

Choose **Filter** from the menu or press **f**.

![add filter](14-addfilter.png)

You want to add a filter so that this window only contains rows for machines that have a current average temperature above the max specified for the machine.

Double-click on **1** under **Other** to edit the filter expression.

![change filter expression](15-changefilterexp.png)

Change the filter expression to: `AVG_TEMP.AVG_TEMP > AVG_TEMP.MAX_TEMP`. Use **Ctrl+Space** for completion assist.

### Compile and check for errors


Click the **Compile Streaming Project (F7)** button to check for errors.

![compile for error](17-compileforerror.png)

> Note: You will get a compiler warning about the lack of a retention policy on the aggregate stream.  You can ignore this warning. The reason for the warning is that windows default to KEEP ALL. If you explicitly state KEEP ALL, then the compiler accepts that you meant it. If you omit an explicit KEEP policy, the compiler warns you in case it's not what you intended. Here, this is an aggregation where you are grouping by Machine ID - and you do indeed want to keep the aggregate value for every machine ID.
