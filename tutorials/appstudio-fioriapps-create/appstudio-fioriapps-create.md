# Create an SAP Fiori App Using SAP Business Application Studio
<!-- description --> Develop a simple SAPUI5 freestyle application, adhering to SAP Fiori design guidelines, that will present a list of suppliers from an on-premise backend.

## Prerequisites
  - You have created an SAP Fiori dev space in SAP Business Application Studio. See [Create a preconfigured dev space for developing SAP Fiori apps](appstudio-devspace-fiori-create).
  - The SAP Fiori dev space is in status `RUNNING` and you opened it.
  - You configured a destination to SAP Gateway Demo System (ES5) (see [Connect SAP BTP to Your SAP Gateway Demo System Account (ES5)](cp-portal-cloud-foundry-gateway-connection)).


## You will learn
  - How to create an SAPUI5 application for SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment
  - How to test-run the app locally in the dev space

## Intro
You'll build an application that presents a list of suppliers from an on-premise backend. The suppliers' data will be retrieved from the `BusinessPartnerSet` collection in the `ZGWSAMPLE_BASIC` OData service that is available from SAP's ES5 demo Gateway system.

The flow consists of the following parts:

1. Running a wizard that creates a multi-target application (MTA) project that is configured to use Managed Application Router. An MTA  is required in order to create the deployment artifact for SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. If you are not familiar with the MTA concepts, read this [guide](https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/06/e2f618e4-757c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html). A Managed Application Router is SAP's best practice for applications that run on SAP BTP as well as required in order to include the app in SAP launchpad. To learn more on Managed Application Router refer to this [guide](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/11d77aa154f64c2e83cc9652a78bb985.html).

2. Running a wizard that generates the app based on SAPUI5 Application template. The app is generated as an HTML5 module within the MTA.

3. Enhancing the application by creating the UI and presenting data fetched from an SAP backend.

>**Important**

>After a period of idle time the dev space is automatically stopped. In order to re-start the dev space open the [dev space manager](https://triallink.eu10.trial.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/), click the **Play** icon, and click the dev space.

>The period for idle time for Enterprise accounts is different than for trial accounts.

### Create new Multitarget Application project


1. In the menu bar, select **View | Find Command** to open the **command palette**.

    <!-- border -->![open command palette](BAS-Create-MTA-1-.png)

2. The command palette is opened at the top-center of the SAP Business Application Studio window.

    <!-- border -->![command palette opened](AppStudio-Create-MTA-2-.png)

3. Enter the **Fiori: Open CF Application Router Generator** command in the command palette. Type `fiori: open` in the command palette text field to filter the commands.

    >Filter the list of commands in the command palette by typing part of the command in the command palette text field.

    <!-- border -->![cf mta and approuter wizard](BAS-Create-MTA-3-.png)

4. The **Application Router Generator Wizard** tab is opened. For **Application Router Configuration**, select the following, and click **Finish**.

    | Step | Parameter | Value |
    |:-----|:----------|:------|
    | A | Application router project path | **/home/user/projects** (default) |
    | B | MTA ID | **`FioriDemo`** |
    | C | MTA Description | Can be left empty (default) |
    | D | Add route module | **Managed Approuter** |

    <!-- border -->![Fill-in cf mta and approuter wizard](BAS-Create-MTA-4-.png)

    >When end-users access an app in the Cloud Foundry environment, they actually access the Application Router first. The application router is used to serve static content, authenticate users, rewrite URLs, and forward or proxy requests to other micro services while propagating user information.

    >The recommendation is to use **Managed Application Router** that provides many benefits, when compared to Standalone Application Router, such as save resources, lower maintenance efforts, etc. Standalone Application Router should only be used in advanced cases, for example when application router extensibility is required. More information is available in [Developing HTML5 Applications in the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/11d77aa154f64c2e83cc9652a78bb985.html)

5. Wait until the creation of project is completed. A notification that "The files has been generated" appears at the bottom right of the screen.

    <!-- border -->![project creation completed](BAS-Create-MTA-5-.png)


### Open the project's workspace


Your workspace is an entity containing your project's settings, debug configurations, and task configurations. In SAP Business Application Studio, a workspace is created for you as part of the Project Creation wizard. You can choose to create a new workspace or for each project, or you can set up a multi-root environment. You can find out more about **Workspaces** in the SAP Business Application Studio [documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/Cloud/en-US/0919ce1ca4a342628e49c0f5e9c8cdcf.html).

1. In the menu bar, select **File | Open Workspace...** to open the **Open Workspace** dialog.

    <!-- border -->![open workspace dialog](BAS-Open-Workspace-1-.png)

2. The **Open Workspace** dialog is opened at the center of the SAP Business Application Studio window. Select the **`FioriDemo`** project within the **projects** folder, and click **Open**.

    <!-- border -->![open workspace dialog](BAS-Open-Workspace-2-1-.png)

3. SAP Business Application Studio reloads with the `FioriDemo` project open in its workspace. In the Explorer view you can see the `FioriDemo` project, its folder structure, and files.

    >The status bar color changes to blue, indicating that a workspace is open.

    <!-- border -->![open workspace dialog](BAS-Open-Workspace-3-.png)


### Generate an app based on SAPUI5 Application template


1. In the **Welcome** tab click **Start from template**.

    <!-- border -->![launch generate app](BAS-Generate-App-1-1-.png)

    >If the Welcome Page does not appear, in the menu bar, select **View | Find Command** to open the **command palette** and select the command **Welcome**. The command palette is opened at the top-center of the SAP Business Application Studio window.

    ><!-- border -->![Welcome Page from help menu](BAS-Welcome-Page-from-Help-Menu-.png)

    >The easiest way to develop an SAPUI5 freestyle app from scratch is to create it from a template. To continue developing an existing application, the best practice is to use git source code management and clone the repository.

    >Using the UI wizard you can at any point click the `Back` button to go back to the previous step, or click the specific wizard step to go back to that step.

    > You can also create a project from the terminal using Yeoman (`@sap/fiori` generator).

2. Select the **SAP Fiori Application** tile, and click **Start**.

    <!-- border -->![fiori template group](BAS-Generate-App-2-1-.png)

### Run the App Locally in the Dev Space


1.	Click the **Run Configurations** view button to open the `Run Configurations` view. A set of run configuration that were created as part of the app generation are presented.

    <!-- border -->![local run](BAS-Local-Run-1-1-.png)

2.	Click the **Play** icon of the **`Start businesspartners`** run configuration to run the app locally in the dev space.

    <!-- border -->![local run](BAS-Local-Run-2-1-.png)

    >You may be prompted to allow pop-ups.

    >The **Debug** view opens, and the status bar color changes to orange, indicating that a debug session is in progress.

    >A new tab opens in SAP Business Application Studio where you can see the log of the running app.

    >You may be prompted to open the app in a new tab.

    <!-- border -->![local run](BAS-Local-Run-3-1-3-.png)

3. A new browser tab opens showing the app. In this stage of the development, the app only shows a title.

    >If the browser tab does not open, or a notification "You have exceeded the number of ports you can expose" appears at the bottom-right of the page, you may need to un-expose ports. Select the **Ports: `Unexpose`** option in the command palette (View | Find Command) to un-expose a port that is in an **[Active]** state. Repeat this procedure until no more than two ports are in **[Active]** state, and try again.

    <!-- border -->![app running locally](AppStudio-Local-Run-3-.png)



### Open the layout editor and the code editor


The layout editor allows users to easily make changes in the app using a visual editor. In this tutorial, you will make changes so that data from the backend service is displayed when the app is running.

1. Click **Toggle Bottom Panel** to free screen space for the editors pane.

    <!-- border -->![toggle bottom pane](BAS-Close-Bottom-Pane-1-.png)

2. Click the **Explorer** view button to open the `Explorer` view.

    <!-- border -->![open explorer view](BAS-Open-Explorer-View-.png)

3. Choose **`FioriDemo` > `businesspartners` > `webapp` > `view`** and right-click the `Suppliers.view.xml` file that you created with the template in a previous step.

3. Choose **Open With > Layout Editor**.

    <!-- border -->![Open with Layout Editor](BAS-Open-Layout-Editor-1-.png)

    >To have the Layout Editor option available after opening the workspace, you may need to wait a bit for the Layout Editor extension to be loaded.

4. The **Suppliers** view is opened in the **Layout Editor**.

    <!-- border -->![open layout editor](BAS-Open-Layout-Editor-2-.png)

5. Open the `Suppliers.view.xml` file with the code editor and see how modifications in the Layout Editor are manifested in the code editor. It is not mandatory to open both editors for development. You can do the development work using either of the editors or both. In this tutorial you'll have both editors open for demo purposes.

    <!-- border -->![Open code editor](BAS-Open-Code-Editor-1-.png)

6. The **Suppliers** view is opened in the code editor in a tab next to the **Layout Editor**.

    <!-- border -->![open code editor](BAS-Open-Code-Editor-2-.png)

7. For convenience, place the code editor below the Layout Editor. Use the drag & drop functionality.

    <!-- border -->![drag-drop editor](BAS-Drag-Drop-Code-Editor-1-.png)

    >The **Layout Editor** and code editor are stacked so you can see how making changes to one will be reflected on the other.

    ><!-- border -->![drag-drop editor](BAS-Drag-Drop-Code-Editor-2-.png)



### Make changes to the UI


1. Edit your app using the layout editor, with no need to do any coding.

    >Tip 1: Since auto save is enabled by default, every change to a file triggers the live reload of the app. If you place the browser where the app is running and the browser where SAP Business Application Studio is running side by side, you'll be able to see how code changes trigger the app's live reload.

    >Tip 2: To trigger live reload only when you save a file, in the menu bar, select **File | Auto Save** to toggle auto save from enable (default) to disable. A 'V' next to auto save indicates that  auto save is enabled.

2. In the **Controls** pane, enter `List` to filter the controls list in the search box.

    <!-- border -->![Filter List control](BAS-Enhance-App-1-.png)

    >In order to get more screen real-estate, click the **Explorer** view button to close the `Explorer` view, and adjust the ratio between the Layout Editor and the code editor.


3. Drag the **List** control and drop it on the **View** control in the canvas.

    <!-- border -->![Drag and drop](BAS-Enhance-App-2-.png)

    >Adding the list control to the view is reflected in both the **Layout Editor** and the code editor.

    ><!-- border -->![Link text e.g., Destination screen](BAS-Enhance-App-2-2-.png)

4. Select the **Standard List Item** control by clicking the **List** control you just added (the breadcrumb indicates which control is selected) and, in the **Entity Set** property in the **Properties** pane, click the Bind icon.

    <!-- border -->![Open entity set bind window](BAS-Enhance-App-3-.png)

    >The **Select Entity Set** view is displayed.

5. Select the **Define entity set and set the selected control as template** option, and in the **Entity Set** dropdown list, choose the `BusinessPartnerSet` entity set. Click **Bind** to complete the operation.

    <!-- border -->![entity set bind window](BAS-Enhance-App-4-.png)

    >The space of the **Select Entity Set** view may be too narrow to show all options. In case you do not see the **Define entity set and set the selected control as template** option, scroll down in the **Select Entity Set** view to make it available.

    >The bind operation is reflected in both the **Layout Editor** and the code editor.

    ><!-- border -->![entity set bind window](BAS-Enhance-App-5-.png)

6. In the **Properties** pane, in the **Title** property, click the **Bind** icon.

    <!-- border -->![open Title bind window](BAS-Enhance-App-5-2-.png)

    >The **Data Binding** view is displayed.

7. Click the **Clear expression** (eraser) icon to clear the default text, and in the data fields double click  `CompanyName`. Click **Bind** to complete the operation.

    <!-- border -->![Title bound](BAS-Enhance-App-6-.png)

8. Repeat the last two steps for the **Description** property in the **Properties** pane. Choose  `WebAddress`.

    <!-- border -->![Bind Description](BAS-Enhance-App-8-.png)

9. Wait for the live reload of the app to complete. A list of suppliers is displayed.
