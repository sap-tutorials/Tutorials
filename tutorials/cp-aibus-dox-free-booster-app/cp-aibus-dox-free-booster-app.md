### Run booster


SAP Business Technology Platform creates interactive guided boosters to automate cockpit steps, so users can save time when trying out the services.

Now, you will use the **Set up account for Document Information Extraction** booster to automatically assign entitlements, update your subaccount (or create a new one), create a service instance, subscribe to and access the Document Information Extraction UI.

1. On the navigation side bar, click **Boosters**.

5. If you want to create a dedicated subaccount for the service instance, choose **Create Subaccount**. If you want to use an already created subaccount, choose **Select Subaccount** (the selection comes in the next step). For this tutorial, we'll create a dedicated subaccount. When you're done with the selection, click **Next**.

6. Choose the **free** plan. You can also rename the subaccount to `doc-free-tier-service-plan-tutorial`, for example. Choose the region closest to you. For this tutorial, we'll use **Europe (Frankfurt) - AWS**. Click **Next**.

    >You can also perform this tutorial series using the `blocks_of_100` service plan. For that, choose the `blocks_of_100` plan in this step (instead of free). For more information on the service plans available for Document Information Extraction, see [Service Plans](https://help.sap.com/docs/DOCUMENT_INFORMATION_EXTRACTION/5fa7265b9ff64d73bac7cec61ee55ae6/2c17b2aa8d6b4fa8a5c6259a33feb360.html).

7. Click **Finish**.

>If you face any issue with the booster **Set up account for Document Information Extraction**, you can alternatively follow the steps in [Use Free Tier to Subscribe to Document Information Extraction UI](cp-aibus-dox-free-ui-sub) to subscribe to the user interface application manually.

Step 4 is optional. If you're not interested, you can set it to **Done** and go directly to the next tutorial.



### Access subscription (optional)


> This is an optional step. Use it only if you want to access the subscription to the Document Information Extraction UI, you've created with the **Set up account for Document Information Extraction** booster, without having to run it once again.

Do the following to access your subscription to the Document Information Extraction UI, without having to run the **Set up account for Document Information Extraction** booster once again:

1. Close the booster **Success** dialog box.
