[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Customize the UI screens for the onboarding flow)]

The onboarding flow is comprised of the following UI components:

-	End user license agreement (EULA) screen
-	Activation screen
-	Authentication screen
-	Set passcode and verify passcode screens
-	Usage consent screen and crash report consent screens.

The visibility and the content of each screen will vary depending on the different application configurations and client code customization.

[OPTION BEGIN [Java]]

1.  By default, the first screen of the onboarding flow is the EULA screen. This screen allows users to review and agree to the end user license agreement. To exclude this screen, create a **`FlowOptions`** instance that overrides the **`excludeOnBoardingEulaScreen`** function to return the value **`true`** and set this **`FlowOptions`** instance for the **`FlowContext`** instance to start the onboarding flow.

    ```Java
    FlowContext flowContext = new FlowContextBuilder()
                .setApplication(appConfig)
                .setFlowOptions(new FlowOptions(){
                    @Override
                    public boolean excludeOnBoardingEulaScreen() {
                        return true;
                    }
                }).build();
    Flow.start(this, flowContext);
    ```

    Notice that if the EULA screen is excluded, it will be the responsibility of the client code to handle the end user license agreement.

2.  If the **`AppConfig`** instance in **`FlowContext`** does not provide the authentication info or host for the mobile application, the activation screen will be displayed to get the complete **`AppConfig`** from either the `Discovery Service` or `QR code scanning`. By default, the activation screen will be displayed for  both activation methods for the user to select. The client code can customize the screen to display only one of these methods.

    Create a **`FlowOptions`** instance that overrides the **`activationOption`** function to return the **`ActivationOption`**, **`ActivationOption.DS_ONLY`** value to display the `Discovery Service` method only, and **`ActivationOption.QR_ONLY`** to display the `QR code scanning` method only. Using the code snippet below, the activation screen will only display the option for scanning a QR code.

    ```Java
    FlowContext flowContext = new FlowContextBuilder()
                .setApplication(new AppConfig.Builder().applicationId("app_id").build())
                .setFlowOptions(new FlowOptions(){
                    @NotNull
                    @Override
                    public ActivationOption activationOption() {
                        return ActivationOption.QR_ONLY;
                    }
                }).build();
    Flow.start(this, flowContext);
    ```

    Notice that if the **`AppConfig`** instance contains complete information, the onboarding flow will skip the activation screen and go directly to the authentication step.

3.  After getting the complete application configuration, the onboarding flow will display different authentication screens based on the authentication type defined for the application. For example, a screen with user input for `User Name` and `Password` properties will be displayed if the authentication type is `Basic`. If the authentication type is `SAML`, the screen will redirect to a web page for user login. The logic to decide which authentication screen to display is built into the onboarding flow and client code cannot change it.

4.  The set passcode and verify passcode screen will be skipped if a passcode policy is not enabled on the server side. Notice that in multi-user mode, the passcode step cannot be skipped and a default passcode policy will be created if it's not enabled on the server.

    Also, the usage consent screen will be skipped if usage reporting is not enabled and the crash report screen will be skipped if crash reporting is not enabled. Otherwise the screens will be displayed in the  onboarding flow, the and client code cannot alter this fact. To enable the usage reporting and crash reporting services, the client code needs start them using the **`SDKInitializer`** class.

    ```Java
    List<MobileService> services = new ArrayList<>();
    services.add(new UsageService());
    services.add(new CrashService());

    SDKInitializer.INSTANCE.start(this, services.toArray(new MobileService[0]), null);
    ```

5.  Besides the options to include or exclude a step, you can set the client code to customize screens using its  **`ScreenSettings`**, including the title, description and button text for all screens. For some specific screens, such as EULA screen, the client code can specify its own URL for the EULA file. See [Onboarding Screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/features/onboarding/android/fiori-screens/introduction.html) in the help documentation for information on the detailed settings for each screen in the onboarding process.

    To have the customized screen settings take effect in the onboarding flow, set the list of **`ScreenSettings`** for the **`FlowContext`** instance.

    ```Java
    List settingsList = new ArrayList<ScreenSettings>();
    EulaScreenSettings eulaScreenSettings = new EulaScreenSettings.Builder().setEulaUrl(
            "file:///android_asset/my_eula.html").build();
    settingsList.add(eulaScreenSettings);
    SetPasscodeScreenSettings setPasscodeScreenSettings =
            new SetPasscodeScreenSettings.Builder().setInstruction("Set my passcode").build();
    settingsList.add(setPasscodeScreenSettings);

    FlowContext flowContext = new FlowContextBuilder()
                .setApplication(new AppConfig.Builder().applicationId("app_id").build())
                .setScreenSettings(settingsList)
                .build();
    Flow.start(this, flowContext);
    ```

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Kotlin]]

1.  By default, the first screen of the onboarding flow is the EULA screen. This screen allows users to review and agree to the end user license agreement. To exclude this screen, set the value of **`excludeEula parameter`** to **`true`** for the **`FlowOptions`** instance and set this **`FlowOptions`** instance for the **`FlowContext`** instance to start the onboarding flow.

    ```Kotlin
    val flowContext =
                FlowContextBuilder()
                        .setApplication(appConfig)
                        .setFlowOptions(FlowOptions(
                                excludeEula = true
                        ))
                        .build()
    Flow.start(activity, flowContext)
    ```

    Notice that if the EULA screen is excluded, it will be the responsibility of the client code to handle the end user license agreement.

2.  If the **`AppConfig`** instance in **`FlowContext`** does not provide the authentication info or host for the mobile application, the activation screen will be displayed to get the complete **`AppConfig`** from either the `Discovery Service` or `QR code scanning`. By default, the activation screen will be displayed for  both activation methods for the user to select. The client code can customize the screen to display only one of these methods.

    Create a **`FlowOptions`** instance and set the value for **`activationOption`** parameter, **`ActivationOption.DS_ONLY`** value to display the `Discovery Service` method only and **`ActivationOption.QR_ONLY`** value to display the `QR code scanning` method only. Using the code snippet below, the activation screen will only display the option for scanning a QR code.

    ```Kotlin
    val flowContext =
                FlowContextBuilder()
                        .setApplication(AppConfig.Builder().applicationId("app_id").build())
                        .setFlowOptions(FlowOptions(
                                activationOption = ActivationOption.QR_ONLY
                        ))
                        .build()
    Flow.start(activity, flowContext)
    ```

    Notice that if the **`AppConfig`** instance contains complete information, the onboarding flow will skip the activation screen and go directly to the authentication step.


3.  After getting the complete application configuration, the onboarding flow will display different authentication screens based on the authentication type defined for the application. For example, a screen with user input for `User Name` and `Password` properties will be displayed if the authentication type is `Basic`. If the authentication type is `SAML`, the screen will redirect to a web page for user login. The logic to decide which authentication screen to display is built into the onboarding flow and client code cannot change it.

4.  The set passcode and verify passcode screen will be skipped if a passcode policy is not enabled on the server side. Notice that in multi-user mode, the passcode step cannot be skipped and a default passcode policy will be created if it's not enabled on the server.

    Also, the usage consent screen will be skipped if usage reporting is not enabled and the crash report screen will be skipped if crash reporting is not enabled. Otherwise the screens will be displayed in the  onboarding flow, the and client code cannot alter this fact. To enable the usage reporting and crash reporting services, the client code needs start them using the **`SDKInitializer`** class.

    ```Kotlin
    val services = mutableListOf<MobileService>()
    services.add(UsageService())
    services.add(CrashService())

    SDKInitializer.start(this, * services.toTypedArray())
    ```

5.  Besides the options to include or exclude a step, you can set the client code to customize screens using its  **`ScreenSettings`**, including the title, description and button text for all screens. For some specific screens, such as EULA screen, the client code can specify its own URL for the EULA file.

    To have the customized screen settings take effect in the onboarding flow, set the list of **`ScreenSettings`** for the **`FlowContext`** instance.

    ```Kotlin
    val eulaSettings = EulaScreenSettings.Builder()
                .setEulaUrl("file:///android_asset/my_eula.html")
                .build()
    val setPasscodeScreenSettings = SetPasscodeScreenSettings.Builder()
                .setInstruction("Set my passcode")
                .build()
    val flowContext =
                FlowContextBuilder()
                        .setApplication(AppConfig.Builder().applicationId("app_id").build())
                        .setScreenSettings(listOf(eulaSettings, setPasscodeScreenSettings))

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Listen to the flow states)]

In this section, we explain the onboarding-related callbacks in **`FlowStateListener`** based on the **`WizardFlowStateListener`** class generated by the SAP BTP SDK Wizard for Android.

[OPTION BEGIN [Java]]
1.  Open the project you previously created using the SAP BTP SDK Wizard for Android.

2.  In Android Studio, on Windows, press **`Ctrl+N`**, or, on a Mac, press **`command+O`**, and type **`WizardFlowStateListener`** to open `WizardFlowStateListener.java`.

3.  On Windows, press **`Ctrl+F12`**, or, on a Mac, press **`command+F12`**, and type **`onAppConfigRetrieved`** to move to the `onAppConfigRetrieved` method. The event is notified when the **`AppConfig`** instance is retrieved from either the Discovery Service or QR code scan. Client code can perform the initialization when the **`AppConfig`** is ready.

    !![App Ready](app-ready-java.png)

4.  On Windows, press **`Ctrl+F12`**, or, on a Mac, press **`command+F12`**, and type **`onClientPolicyRetrieved`** to move to the `onClientPolicyRetrieved` method. After authentication is completed, the onboarding flow will get the client policies from the mobile server and then notify this event. The client code can then create the UI to display the settings.

    !![Policy Ready](policy-ready-java.png)

5.  For an offline application, on Windows, press **`Ctrl+F12`**, or, on a Mac, press **`command+F12`**, and type **`onOfflineEncryptionKeyReady`** to move to the `onOfflineEncryptionKeyReady` method. After setting passcode, the onboarding flow will get the offline OData store encryption key and then notify this event. Notice that this callback is only used for offline applications.

    !![Offline Key Ready](offline-key-ready-java.png)

6.  Besides the callbacks implemented in the **`WizardFlowStateListener`** class, the **`OkHttpClientReady`** method is also useful if you want to add an HTTP header into the **`OkHttpClient`** instance. Before authentication, the **`OkHttpClient`** instance will be ready and sent to the client code using `onOkHttpClientReady`. To add your own HTTP header, override the **`onOkHttpClientReady`** method in your flow state listener.

    ```Java
    @Override
    public void onOkHttpClientReady(@NotNull OkHttpClient httpClient) {
        OkHttpClient newClient = FlowUtilKt.addUniqueInterceptor(httpClient, chain -> {
            Request request = chain.request();
            Request newRequest = request.newBuilder()
                    .header("my_header", "my_header_value")
                    .build();
            return chain.proceed(newRequest);
        });
    }
    ```

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Kotlin]]
1.  Open the project you previously created using the SAP BTP SDK Wizard for Android.

2.  In Android Studio, on Windows, press **`Ctrl+N`**, or, on a Mac, press **`command+O`**, and type **`WizardFlowStateListener`** to open `WizardFlowStateListener.kt`.

3.  On Windows, press **`Ctrl+F12`**, or, on a Mac, press **`command+F12`**, and type **`onAppConfigRetrieved`** to move to the `onAppConfigRetrieved` method. The event is notified when the **`AppConfig`** instance is retrieved from either the Discovery Service or QR code scan. Client code can perform the initialization when the **`AppConfig`** is ready.

    !![App Ready](app-ready-kotlin.png)

Before authentication, the **`OkHttpClient`** instance will be ready and sent to the client code using `onOkHttpClientReady`. To add your own HTTP header, override the **`OkHttpClientReady`** method in your flow state listener.

    ```Kotlin
    override fun onOkHttpClientReady(httpClient: OkHttpClient) {
        httpClient.addUniqueInterceptor( object: Interceptor {
            override fun intercept(chain: Interceptor.Chain): Response {
                val request: Request = chain.request()
                val newRequest = request.newBuilder()
                    .header("my_header", "my_header_value")
                    .build()
                return chain.proceed(newRequest)
            }
        })
    }

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Insert your own logic using action handler)]

The **`FlowActionHandler`** class allows you to insert your own logic at certain points in the onboarding flow, such as adding your own passcode validation or barcode validation after the default rules are executed, adding an algorithm for user name or email obfuscation when displaying the user information, or adding a parser for barcode content when scanning QR codes, etc.

Similar to the **`FlowStateListener`**, you need to extend the **`FlowActionHandler`** class to implement the corresponding methods and set your own **`FlowActionHandler`** instance for the **`FlowContext`** instance using the `FlowContext.setFlowStateListener(listener: FlowStateListener)` method.

This section provides some sample implementations for the methods in the **`FlowActionHandler`** class.

[OPTION BEGIN [Java]]
1.  The **`FlowActionHandler`** provides three methods related to passcode validation:

    **`open fun isPasscodeDigitOnly(): Boolean`**

    **`open fun isLocalizingPasscodeDigitsToLatin(): Boolean`**

    **`open fun validatePasscode(code: CharArray): Boolean`**

    The first two methods allow you to add additional rules for passcode policy and the last method is for you to add your own validation logic in additional to the rules defined in the passcode policy. For example, when the passcode policy allows special characters, you can still add the logic to disable certain special characters. For instance, the sample code below prevents the user from being able to use "@" as one of the possible special character:

    ```Java
    @Override
    public boolean validatePasscode(@NotNull char[] code) {
        if(code.toString().contains("@")) {
            return false;
        }
        return super.validatePasscode(code);
    }
    ```

2.  The **`FlowActionHandler`** provides two methods related to the QR code:

    **`open fun validateBarcode(barcode: String): ServiceResult<Boolean>`**

    **`open fun parsingBarcode(barcode: String): AppConfig?`**

    The first method allows you to add customized validation logic and the second method allows the client code to parse the QR code and construct the **`AppConfig`** instance using its own logic.

    For example, you can specify that the QR code must contain some particular properties:

    ```Java
    @NotNull
    @Override
    public ServiceResult<Boolean> validateBarcode(@NotNull String barcode) {
        if (barcode != null && barcode.contains("AppId") && barcode.contains("ClientId")
                && barcode.contains("AuthorizationEndpointUrl")
                && barcode.contains("ServerUrl") && barcode.contains("RedirectUrl")
                && barcode.contains("TokenUrl")) {
            return new ServiceResult.SUCCESS(true);
        } else {
            return new ServiceResult.FAILURE("");
        }
    }
    ```

3.  The **`FlowActionHandler`** provides two methods related to the certificate handling:

    **`open fun getCertificateProvider(): CertificateProvider`**

    **`onCertificateSslClientAuthPrepared(): SslClientAuth?`**

    The first method allows you to provide a customized `CertificateProvider` for a certificate challenge and the second method allows you to provide your own `SslClientAuth` for certificate authentication.

    For example, you can create a **`SslClientAuth`** instance using a **`ChooseCertificateProvider`** instance to pop up a dialog for user to choose a certificate:

    ```Java
    @Override
    public SslClientAuth onCertificateSslClientAuthPrepared() {
        ChooseCertificateProvider chooseCertificateProvider = new ChooseCertificateProvider();
        return new SslClientAuth(chooseCertificateProvider);
    }
    ```

4.  The **`FlowActionHandler`** provides two methods for user name and email obfuscation when displaying the information on the sign-in screen:

    **`open fun obfuscateUserName(name: String): String`**

    **`open fun obfuscateEmail(email: String): String`**

    For example, you can choose to not obfuscate the email but obfuscate the user name by keeping the first two characters and replacing the other characters with several "\_" characters:

    ```Java
    @NotNull
    @Override
    public String obfuscateEmail(@NotNull String email) {
        return email;
    }

    @NotNull
    @Override
    public String obfuscateUserName(@NotNull String name) {
        if(name.isEmpty()) {
            return name;
        }
        if (name.length() > 2) {
            return name.substring(0, 2) + "____";
        } else {
            return name.substring(0, 1) + "_____";
        }
    }
    ```

5.  The **`FlowActionHandler`** provides a method for the client code to add "back button press" logic when a web view is displayed for authentication. For some authentication types, the onboarding flow will open a web view for authentication. You can add your own logic to specify what action is taken when the **`Back`** button of the web view is pressed.

    **`open val onWebViewBackPressed: (() -> Unit)?`**

    The following sample code implements a warning dialog when the **`Back`** button is pressed:

    ```Java
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public Function0<Unit> getOnWebViewBackPressed() {
        return () -> {
            Activity activity = AppLifecycleCallbackHandler.getInstance().getActivity();
            new AlertDialog.Builder(activity)
                    .setMessage("Are you sure you want to exit onboarding flow?")
                    .setPositiveButton("OK",
                            new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
                                @Override
                                public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
                                    dialog.dismiss();
                                    activity.finish();
                                }
                            }
                    ).setNegativeButton("Cancel",
                    new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
                        @Override
                        public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
                            dialog.dismiss();
                        }
                    }
            ).create().show();
            return null;
        };
    }
    ```

[OPTION BEGIN [Kotlin]]
1.  The **`FlowActionHandler`** provides three methods related to passcode validation:

    **`open fun isPasscodeDigitOnly(): Boolean`**

    **`open fun isLocalizingPasscodeDigitsToLatin(): Boolean`**

    **`open fun validatePasscode(code: CharArray): Boolean`**

    The first two methods allow you to add additional rules for passcode policy and the last method is for you to add your own validation logic in additional to the rules defined in the passcode policy.

            return false
        }
        return super.validatePasscode(code)
    }
    ```

    **`open fun validateBarcode(barcode: String): ServiceResult<Boolean>`**

    **`open fun parsingBarcode(barcode: String): AppConfig?`**

    The first method allows you to add customized validation logic and the second method allows the client code to parse the QR code and construct the **`AppConfig`** instance using its own logic.

    override fun validateBarcode(barcode: String): ServiceResult<Boolean> {
        return if (barcode != null && barcode.contains("AppId") && barcode.contains("ClientId")
                && barcode.contains("AuthorizationEndpointUrl")
                && barcode.contains("ServerUrl") && barcode.contains("RedirectUrl")
                && barcode.contains("TokenUrl")) {
            ServiceResult.SUCCESS(true)
        } else {
            ServiceResult.FAILURE("")

3.  The **`FlowActionHandler`** provides two methods related to the certificate handling:

    **`open fun getCertificateProvider(): CertificateProvider`**

    **`onCertificateSslClientAuthPrepared(): SslClientAuth?`**

    The first method allows you to provide a customized `CertificateProvider` for a certificate challenge and the second method allows you to provide your own `SslClientAuth` for certificate authentication.

    For example, you can create a **`SslClientAuth`** instance using a **`ChooseCertificateProvider`** instance to pop up a dialog for user to choose a certificate:

    ```Kotlin
    override fun onCertificateSslClientAuthPrepared(): SslClientAuth {
        val chooseCertificateProvider = ChooseCertificateProvider()
        return SslClientAuth(chooseCertificateProvider)
    }
    ```

4.  The **`FlowActionHandler`** provides two methods for user name and email obfuscation when displaying the information on sign-in screen:

    **`open fun obfuscateUserName(name: String): String`**

    **`open fun obfuscateEmail(email: String): String`**

    For example, you can choose to not obfuscate the email but obfuscate the user name by keeping the first two characters and replacing the other characters with several "\_" characters:

    ```Kotlin
    override fun obfuscateEmail(email: String): String {
        return email
    }

    override fun obfuscateUserName(name: String): String {
        if (name.isEmpty()) {
            return name
        }
        return if (name.length > 2) {
            name.substring(0, 2) + "____"
        } else {
            name.substring(0, 1) + "_____"
        }
    }
    ```

5.  The **`FlowActionHandler`** provides a method for the client code to add "back button press" logic when a web view is displayed for authentication. For some authentication types, the onboarding flow will open a web view for authentication. You can add your own logic to specify what action is taken when the **`Back`** button of the web view is pressed.

    **`open val onWebViewBackPressed: (() -> Unit)?`**

    The following sample code implements a warning dialog when the **`Back`** button is pressed:

    ```Kotlin
    override val onWebViewBackPressed: () -> Unit = {
        val activity = AppLifecycleCallbackHandler.getInstance().activity
        activity?.let {
            AlertDialog.Builder(activity)
                .setMessage("Are you sure you want to exit onboarding flow?")
                .setPositiveButton("OK") { dialog, _ ->
                    activity.finish()
                    dialog.dismiss()
                }.setNegativeButton("Cancel") { dialog, _ ->
                    dialog.dismiss()
                }.show()
        }
    }
    ```
