[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Create MDK actions to register for push notifications)]

In this step, you will create the following actions:

* **Push Notification Register action**: this will register the device with SAP Mobile Services for push notification.

* **Message actions**: these will display a message if Push Notification Register action has succeeded or failed.


1. Create a Push Notification Register action.

    Right-click the **Actions** folder | **MDK: New Action** | choose **MDK Other Actions** in **Category** | click **Push Notification Register Action** | **Next**.

    !![MDK](img_3.1.1.png)

    Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the confirmation step.

2. Define a success message if the Push Register Notification action is succeeded.

    Right-click the **Actions** folder | **MDK: New Action** | choose **MDK Message Actions** in **Category** | click **Message Action** | **Next**.

    !![MDK](img_3.2.1.png)

    Provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Action Name`| `PushRegisterSuccessMessage` |
    | `Type` | Select `Message` from the dropdown |
    | `Message` | `Push Notification registered` |

    | `OnOK` | `--None--` |
    | `CancelCaption` | leave it blank |
    | `OnCancel` | `--None--` |

    !![MDK](img_3.2.2.png)

    Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the confirmation step.


3. Define a failure message if the Push Register Notification action is failed.

    Right-click the **Actions** folder | **MDK: New Action** | choose **MDK Message Actions** in **Category** | click **Message Action** | **Next**.

    !![MDK](img_3.2.1.png)

    Provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|

    !![MDK](img_3.3.2.png)

    Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the confirmation step.

4. Define _Success_ and _Failure_ actions for `PushRegister.action`.

    In the action editor for the new action, expand the **Common Action Properties** and provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Success Action` | Click the link icon to bind it to `PushRegisterSuccessMessage.action` |
    | `Failure Action` | Click the link icon to bind it to `PushRegisterFailureMessage.action`  |

    >When `PushRegister.action` gets executed successfully then `PushRegisterSuccessMessage.action` will be triggered or if `PushRegister.action` fails then `PushRegisterFailureMessage.action` will be triggered.
