[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Understand SAP Mobile Cards)]

SAP Mobile Cards is a feature within SAP Mobile Services which provides customers access to a micro-application platform to publish data into a consumer-grade wallet or passbook-style app.

It allows companies to quickly create simple, yet highly valuable quick-win apps. These apps can give access to useful organisational tools like to do lists, payslips, time sheets and workflows like Leave request approvals, or Purchase Order approvals.

You can read more about the features [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/getting-started/mck/mck-overview.html).

You can see the list of templates shipped out of the box [here](https://github.com/SAP-samples/mobile-cards-templates).
