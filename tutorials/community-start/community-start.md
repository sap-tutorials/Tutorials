[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Set your profile to public)]

In order to participate fully in the SAP Community, you need to set your account privacy settings to opt in to display your profile publicly. If you don't, you will still be able to read SAP Community content, but you won't be able to ask questions, write blog posts, or engage in any other way in the community. To learn more, please see our [Privacy - FAQ](https://community.sap.com/resources/privacy) page.

1. Watch this SAP Community video [Changing Privacy Settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BnkWDfjVlU&feature=youtu.be).

2. Go to your SAP.com profile **Dashboard** (accessible by clicking your avatar in the upper right and using the **My Profile** feature), select **Privacy** (found under **Account & Settings** on the left-hand side), and make sure that **I want my profile to be visible to public** is switched to **`Allow`**.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Upload a profile photo)]

Replacing your placeholder avatar image with a profile picture humanizes you and helps you connect better with other SAP Community members. If you choose to participate in the community, your photo will appear as an avatar on your posts, drawing readers to and into your content.

1. Go to the **Community Videos** page, accessible from the general [Community Resources](https://community.sap.com/resources) section.

2. Find the video on **Uploading a Profile Photo**.

3. Watch the video to learn how to upload a photo to your profile in SAP Community.

4. Follow the instructions and upload a profile photo.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Set your communications preferences)]

Email notifications can let you know when something happens related to your published questions or blog posts. They can also update you about content that interests you.

!![communications](communications.png)

Go to your SAP.com profile **Dashboard** (accessible by clicking your avatar in the upper right), select **Communications** (found under **Account & Settings**), and choose which email notifications you would like to receive.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Follow tags, content, and people)]

Once you have set your profile to public, you can follow a person or a tag, as well as a specific question or blog post.

  - When you follow a person, you can see that person's activities in your **Activity Stream** (accessible by clicking your avatar in the upper right).
  - When you follow a tag, you can also see new content (blog posts or questions and answers) posted with that tag in your **Activity Stream**.
  - When you follow content (i.e., questions and blog posts), activities related to that content (such as comments and answers) will appear in **Activity Stream**.

Take these steps to follow tags, content, and people.

In order for your blogging permissions to change from **Subscriber** to **Contributor**, you MUST perform ALL of the activities in this step before you click **Done**. Activities taken previously, or just clicking **Done** without doing the activities, will not enable the permission change. (If you wish to undo the activities afterwards, for example unfollow a piece of content you followed for this step, you may do so.)

### Follow a tag

1. Go to the main [Questions and Answers page](https://answers.sap.com/index.html) or the [main Blogs page](https://blogs.sap.com/).

2. Find **Popular Tags** on the right-hand side (expanding the list if necessary) and click **View All**.

    ![popular_tags](popular_tags.png)

3. Click a tag that interests you on the **All Tags** page to go to that tag's page.

4. Click the blue **Follow** button in the top left-hand corner of the tag page to follow that tag.

### Follow a person

1. Click on a linked name in the community to go to that person's profile page.

2. Click the **+Follow** button in the top right-hand corner of the person's profile page.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Review the Rules of Engagement - Part 1)]

Understanding the [SAP Community Rules of Engagement](https://community.sap.com/resources/rules-of-engagement) will allow you to be active in the community without encountering issues or negative feedback when you post a question, answer, or blog post.

There are two sections of the Rules of Engagement: **Participation Etiquette** and **Unacceptable Content**. This step covers **Participation Etiquette**.

Completing this tutorial will grant you the ability to write blog posts (if you don't already have these permissions in SAP Community). Simply log out and log back into your SAP user account to see the changes in your blogging permissions.
