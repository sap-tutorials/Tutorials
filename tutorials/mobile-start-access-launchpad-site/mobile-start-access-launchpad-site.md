3.  In the Settings screen, choose the **SAP Mobile Start Application** tab.

    (If the option is not available make sure SAP Mobile Start is enabled in the Site Settings (Step 1), also refreshing the site might  be required for your changes to become active)

    In this screen you can switch between two QR Codes via the toggle button:

      1. **Install**:
      This QR-Code can be used to install the SAP Mobile Start app on your device. It's a direct link to the Apple app store page.

      2. **Register**:
      This QR-Code is used later within the SAP Mobile Start app to register it to your site.

    (In the future it's planned to offer an option to have SAP Mobile Start deployed via MDM. With that, a specific site can be preconfigured and no QR-Code registration is needed.)




### Install SAP Mobile Start on your mobile device


Use the Install QR-Code from Step 2 to install SAP Mobile Start on your Mobile Device. Alternatively, you can search for SAP Mobile Start in the respective App Stores.
