[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Prepare the Recording)]

What is the Recorder?

You can automate complex workflows easily using the **Recorder** in **Cloud Studio**. It automatically captures applications and designs automations accurately at the same time. The **Recorder** records the steps you perform across the screens of an application. Then you can export the recording in the automation designer of the **Cloud Studio** where a workflow is built.

Make sure your screen display settings (Scale and layout) are set to 100%.

1.  Switch to your desktop, right-click and select **Display Settings**.

    !![Open Display Settings](step1-display-settings-1.png)
