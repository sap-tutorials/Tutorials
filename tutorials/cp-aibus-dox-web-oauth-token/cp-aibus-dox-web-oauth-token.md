### Get OAuth access token


1. Add **`/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials`** to the `url` value (from inside the `uaa` section of the service key), paste it in any web browser and choose **Enter**.

2. Enter the **`clientid`** value from your service key as **Username**.

3. Enter the **`clientsecret`** value from your service key as **Password**.

4. Click **Sign in** or **OK** (depending on the web browser you work with).

You should receive a response like the following:

```JSON
{
    "access_token": "<< your access token >>",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "expires_in": 43199,
    "scope": "<< granted access >>",
    "jti": "<< unique identifier >>"
}
```

Once the token has been generated, make sure to copy and save it locally for easy access. The token is valid for 12 hours (43199 seconds). After that, you'll need to generate a new one.

You have successfully generated your OAuth access token for the service and you are now all set to [Use Machine Learning to Extract Information from Documents with Swagger UI](cp-aibus-dox-swagger-ui).
