## Intro
SAP EA Designer lets you capture, analyze, and present your organization's landscapes, strategies, requirements, processes, data, and other artifacts in a shared environment. Using industry-standard notations and techniques, organizations can leverage rich metadata and use models and diagrams to drive understanding and promote shared outcomes in creating innovative systems, information sets, and processes to support goals and capabilities.

SAP EA Designer is a separate download in the Download Manager.

In this procedure you'll download the SAP EA Designer package (`eadesigner.tgz`) using the built-in Download Manager (Console Mode), extract the package, and run the installation script.

### Run the memory management script


The `hxe_gc` memory management script frees up available VM memory.

-   In your VM, log in as `hxeadm` and enter:

    ```bash
    cd /usr/sap/HXE/home/bin
    ```

-   Execute:

    ```bash
    
    hxe_gc.sh
    ```

-   When prompted for `System database user (SYSTEM) password`, enter the `New HANA database master password` you specified during SAP HANA, express edition installation.


The cleanup process runs. The command prompt returns when the cleanup process is finished.


### Download `eadesigner.tgz` using the built-in Download Manager


In your VM, from the same directory where you ran `hxe_gc` (`/usr/sap/HXE/home/bin`), enter:

```bash
HXEDownloadManager_linux.bin linuxx86_64 vm eadesigner.tgz
```

In your VM, enter:

```bash
ls
```


### Extract the file.


In your VM, enter:

```bash
tar -xvzf eadesigner.tgz

```bash
cd HANA_EXPRESS_20
```


### Run the installation script


In your VM, enter:

```bash
sh ./install_eadesigner.sh
```

Installation begins.


### Follow the installation prompts


-   When prompted for `HANA instance number [90]` press `Enter` to accept the default.

-   When prompted for `System database user (SYSTEM) password`, enter the `hxeadm` login password.

-   When prompted for `XSA administrator (XSA_ADMIN) password`, enter the `HANA database master password` you specified when you installed SAP HANA 2.0, express edition.



### Complete the installation


When prompted to `Proceed with installation`, enter `Y`. Wait for installation to finish.

A success message displays when installation completes.
