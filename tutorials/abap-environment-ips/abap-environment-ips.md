[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Configure Access to Source via Technical User)]
In this example the IAS itself is used as a source for users and user groups that can be provisioned to other systems.
To allow identity provisioning to read users and groups from the IAS, you need a technical user with corresponding permissions.

1. Navigate to **Users & Authorizations** > **Administrators**

2. Select **Add** and choose **System**

    ![Start Administrator creation](IAS_admin_add.png)

3. Provide a **Name** for the system, for example `ips_tutorial_admin`.
Make sure to only set authorizations for **Read Users** and **Manage Groups** which are both needed to read users and groups during identity provisioning, **Save** your changes.

    ![Configure Administrator Authorizations](IAS_admin_configure.png)

4. A new dialog to **Configure User ID and Password** is displayed. Set the password and select **Save**. The User ID is generated automatically.

    ![Set Password](ias_admin_set_pw.png)

5. Go back to the **Configure User ID and Password** section and **Copy** the generated **User ID** of the technical user.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Configure Source in Identity Provisioning Service)]
Identity provisioning requires to configure a so-called source system for user and user group data.

1. Log on with your Identity Provisioning Manager user to your Identity Authentication tenant's identity provisioning UI (URL ends with path `/ips`, for example https://rapworkshop.accounts.ondemand.com/ips).

2. Select the **Source Systems** tile

    ![Source System Tile](ips_source_systems_tile.png)

3. To start the creation, select **Add**

    ![Add Source System button](ips_source_system_add.png)

4. To simplify the system creation and to reduce the risk of errors, this tutorial provides a template JSON file for the source system. Download [`ips_system_template_source.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/abap-env-ips/ips_system_template_source.json) locally.

5. Define the system by uploading the JSON file via **Browse** in the IPS system UI.

    ![Browse for source system template file](ips_source_systems_browse.png)

6. Adapt the values to your needs and provide the mandatory values for `URL`, `User` and `Password` as shown below.

    Alternatively, you can configure everything manually.

    Details:

    |  Label     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Type           | Identity Authentication
    |  System Name           | For example **`My IAS ABAP Developers`**

    Properties:

    |  Name     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  **`Type`**           | **`HTTP`**
    |  **`ProxyType`**           | **`Internet`**
    |  **`URL`**          | your IAS URL, for example <https://rapworkshop.accounts.ondemand.com>
    |  **`Authentication`** | **`BasicAuthentication`**
    |  **`User`**    | User ID of technical user
    |  **`Password`**   | Password of technical user
    |  **`ias.user.filter`**   | **`groups.display eq "BR_IPS_TUTORIAL_DEVELOPER"`**
    |  **`ias.group.filter`**   | **`displayName eq "BR_IPS_TUTORIAL_DEVELOPER"`**

7. **Save** your changes.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Configure access to Target via Communication User)]
To enable the IAS to create users and assign business roles in the target system, that system has to provide the corresponding authorization to the IAS.

1. Navigate to **Services > Instances and Subscriptions** in your SAP BTP subaccount, search for your ABAP environment instance and select **Create Service Key**

    ![Start Service Key creation for ABAP instance ](btp_service_key_create.png)

2. In the **New Service Key** dialog, provide a name and copy & paste the following JSON code:


    ```JSON
    {
      "scenario_id":"SAP_COM_0193",
      "type":"basic"
    }
    ```

3. **Create** the new service key.

    ![Configure new service key](btp_service_key_configure_new.png)

    >This service key creation automatically creates a communication user (1), communication system (2) and communication arrangement (3) for communication scenario `SAP_COM_0193` (4) in the ABAP environment instance.
    >
    ![Communication Artefacts for IPS in ABAP instance](ABAP_FLP_CA_created.png)
    >
    Communication scenario `SAP_COM_0193` exposes all the needed services for identity provisioning integration. With the communication user credentials, you can make inbound calls to that system to provision users and assign roles per groups.

4. The credentials created for the communication user are also available in the subaccount. To view them, navigate to **Services > Instances and Subscriptions** and select your service instance.

    ![Open Service Instance Details](BTP_ABAP_env_view_details.png)

5. From the Actions menu, choose **View Credentials**.

    ![View Credentials of service instance](BTP_ABAP_env_view_credentials.png)

6. Choose the credentials that you have set earlier as service key for IPS.
Copy the **`username`**, **`password`** and **`url`** value for the next step.
