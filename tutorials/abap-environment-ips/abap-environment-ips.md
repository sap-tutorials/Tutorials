>Note that the Identity Authentication service user will receive an email to activate the account before being able to log on with a local user somewhere for the first time.


### Create Developer Group and Assign User

To bundle developers users, create a corresponding user group in the Identity Authentication service tenant and assign the users to it.

1. Navigate to **Users & Authorizations** > **User Groups** and select **Create**.

    ![Start User Group creation](IAS_group_create.png)

2. In the Create Group dialog enter a **Name** and **Display Name** and select **Create**.

    > For the group name, please use the identical name you have set for the business role in your ABAP environment (created from template `SAP_BR_DEVELOPER`, see prerequisites).

    ![Configure properties of new group](IAS_group_configure_new.png)

3. To add users to the group select **Add**.

    ![Start user adding to group](IAS_group_add_user.png)

4. Search for the user that you have created earlier, select it, and choose **Save**.

    ![Save User Group](IAS_group_add_user_save.png)

Navigate to **Users & Authorizations** > **Administrators** choose the Administrator user, slide the toggle button for **Manage Identity Provisioning** to **ON** and select **Save**.

![Set Identity Provisioning Management](IAS_IPS_admin_configure.png)


### Configure Source in Identity Provisioning Service

Identity provisioning requires to configure a so-called source system for user and user group data.

1. Log on with your Identity Provisioning Manager user to your Identity Authentication service tenant's identity provisioning UI (URL ends with path `/ips`, for example `https://rapworkshop.accounts.ondemand.com/ips`).

2. Select the **Source Systems** tile.

    ![Source System Tile](ips_source_systems_tile.png)

3. To start the creation, select **Add**.

    ![Add Source System button](ips_source_system_add.png)

4. To simplify the system creation and to reduce the risk of errors, this tutorial provides a template JSON file for the source system. Download [`ips_system_template_source.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sap-tutorials/Tutorials/master/tutorials/abap-environment-ips/ips_system_template_source.json) locally.

5. Define the system by uploading the JSON file via **Browse** in the Identity Provisioning service source system UI.

    ![Browse for source system template file](ips_source_systems_browse.png)

6. Adapt the values to your needs and provide the mandatory value for `URL` as shown below.

    Alternatively, you can configure everything manually.

    Details:

    |  Label     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Type           | Identity Authentication
    |  System Name           | For example **`My Identity Authentication service ABAP Developers`**

    Properties:

    |  Name     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  **`Type`**           | **`HTTP`**
    |  **`ProxyType`**           | **`Internet`**
    |  **`URL`**          | your Identity Authentication service tenant URL, for example <https://rapworkshop.accounts.ondemand.com>
    |  **`Authentication`** | **`ClientCertificateAuthentication`**
    |  **`ias.user.filter`**   | **`groups.display eq "BR_IPS_TUTORIAL_DEVELOPER"`**
    |  **`ias.group.filter`**   | **`displayName eq "BR_IPS_TUTORIAL_DEVELOPER"`**

7. **Save** your changes.

8. Switch to the **Outbound C...** (C... like Certificate) tab and **Download** the certificate for later usage.

    ![Download certificate of source system](ips_source_systems_download_cert.png)

9. **Save** again.


### Configure Access to Source via Technical User

In this example the Identity Authentication service itself is used as a source for users and user groups that can be provisioned to other systems.
To allow identity provisioning to read users and groups from the Identity Authentication service, you need a technical user with corresponding permissions.

1. Navigate to **Users & Authorizations** > **Administrators**.

2. Select **Add** and choose **System**.

    ![Start Administrator creation](IAS_admin_add.png)

3. Provide a **Name** for the system, for example `ips_tutorial_admin`.
Make sure to only set authorizations for **Read Users** and **Manage Groups** which are both needed to read users and groups during identity provisioning, **Save** your changes.

    ![Configure Administrator Authorizations](IAS_admin_configure.png)

4. Navigate to **Configure System Authentication** >  **Certificate**.

    ![Configure certificate](ias_admin_configure_cert.png)

5. **Browse** for the certificate of the source system and **Save** the technical user again.

    ![Upload source system's certificate to technical user](ias_admin_save_cert.png)

Now the technical user can be authenticated via the certificate sent by the Identity Provisioning service and has the authorizations to read users and groups in Identity Authentication service tenant.


### Configure Target in Identity Provisioning Service 

Identity provisioning requires to configure a so-called target system for user and user group data.
In this example, the target systems is an ABAP system in SAP BTP.

1. Log on with your Identity Provisioning Manager user to your Identity Authentication tenant's identity provisioning UI (URL ends with path `/ips`, for example <https://rapworkshop.accounts.ondemand.com/ips>).

2. Select the **Target Systems** tile.

    ![Source Target Tile](ips_target_systems_tile.png)

3. To start the Creation, select **Add**.

    ![Add Target System button](ips_target_system_add.png)

4. To simplify the system creation and reduce the risk of errors, this tutorial provides a template JSON file for the source system. Download [`ips_system_template_target.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sap-tutorials/Tutorials/master/tutorials/abap-environment-ips/ips_system_template_target.json) locally.

5. Define the system by uploading the JSON file via **Browse** in the Identity Provisioning service target system UI.

    ![Browse for target system template file](ips_target_systems_browse.png)

6. Adapt the values to your needs and provide the mandatory value for `URL` as shown below.

    Alternatively, you can configure everything manually.

    Details:

    |  Label     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Type           | SAP BTP ABAP environment
    |  System Name           | For example **`My ABAP instance`**
    |  Description           | For example **`System to receive provisioned Developer Users`**
    |  Source System           | Choose the one created earlier from the dropdown

    Properties:

    |  Name     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  **`Type`**           | **`HTTP`**
    |  **`ProxyType`**           | **`Internet`**
    |  **`URL`**          | The API URL of your ABAP environment
    |  **`Authentication`** | **`ClientCertificateAuthentication`**
    |  **`Identity Provisioning ips.date.variable.format`**   | **`yyyy-MM-dd`**

7. **Save** your changes.

8. Switch to the **Outbound C...** (C... like Certificate) tab and **Download** the certificate for later usage.

    ![Download certificate of target system](ips_target_systems_download_cert.png)

9. **Save** again.


### Configure Access to Target via Communication Management

To enable the Identity Authentication service to create users and assign business roles in the target system, that system has to provide the corresponding authorization to the Identity Authentication service. This has to be done in the launchpad of your ABAP environment instance with the user that is authorized to use the **Communication Management** apps.

1. Open the **Maintain Communication Users** app.

    ![Open Maintain Communication Users app](ABAP_FLP_CC_tile.png)

2. Select **New**.

    ![Select an option to create a new user](ABAP_FLP_CC_new.png)

3. Enter a **User Name** for example, `IPS_TUTORIAL_USER`, enter a **Description**, **Upload** the certificate from the Identity Provisioning service target system, and select **Create**.

    ![Maintain and create user](ABAP_FLP_CC_create.png)

4. Open the **Communication Systems** app.

    ![Open Communication Systems app](ABAP_FLP_CS_tile.png)

5. Select **New**.

6. Enter a **System ID** and **System Name**, for example `IPS_TUTORIAL_SYSTEM` in the opening pop up and select **Create**.

    ![Create system](ABAP_FLP_CS_create.png)

7. In the object page of the new communication system under **General** > **Technical Data**, mark the checkbox to make the communication system **Inbound Only**.

    ![Set system as Inbound Only](ABAP_FLP_CS_MarkInboundOnly.png)

8. Under **Users for Inbound Communication**, select the **+** to add a user. In the opening pop up, select the communication user you created earlier and choose **OK** so that the pop up closes.

    ![Add inbound user to system and save](ABAP_FLP_CS_save.png)

9. **Save** the system.

10. Open the **Communication Arrangements** app.

    ![Open Communication Arrangements app](ABAP_FLP_CA_tile.png)

11. Select **New**.

12. A pop up for the creation of a new communication arrangement opens, where you have to select scenario **Identity Provisioning Integration** `SAP_COM_0193`. This communication scenario exposes all the needed services for identity provisioning integration.

    ![Select communication scenario SAP_COM_0193](ABAP_FLP_CA_select_scenario.png)

13. Select **Create**.

    ![Save the communication arrangement](ABAP_FLP_CA_create.png)

14. **Save** the communication arrangement.

Now the communication user can be authenticated via the certificate sent by Identity Provisioning service and has the authorization to create users and assign roles.

<!--service key version--->
<!--1. Navigate to **Services > Instances and Subscriptions** in your SAP BTP subaccount, search for your ABAP environment instance and select **Create Service Key**

    ![Start Service Key creation for ABAP instance ](btp_service_key_create.png)

2. In the **New Service Key** dialog, provide a name and copy & paste the following JSON code:


    ```JSON
    {
      "scenario_id":"SAP_COM_0193",
      "type":"basic"
    }
    ```

3. **Create** the new service key.

    ![Configure new service key](btp_service_key_configure_new.png)

    >This service key creation automatically creates a communication user (1), communication system (2) and communication arrangement (3) for communication scenario `SAP_COM_0193` (4) in the ABAP environment instance.
    >
    ![Communication Artefacts for Identity Provisioning service in ABAP instance](ABAP_FLP_CA_created.png)
    >
    Communication scenario `SAP_COM_0193` exposes all the needed services for identity provisioning integration. With the communication user credentials, you can make inbound calls to that system to provision users and assign roles per groups.

4. The credentials created for the communication user are also available in the subaccount. To view them, navigate to **Services > Instances and Subscriptions** and select your service instance.

    ![Open Service Instance Details](BTP_ABAP_env_view_details.png)

5. From the Actions menu, choose **View Credentials**.

    ![View Credentials of service instance](BTP_ABAP_env_view_credentials.png)

6. Choose the credentials that you have set earlier as service key for Identity Provisioning service.
Copy the **`username`**, **`password`** and **`url`** value for the next step.     

    ![Get communication user credentials from service key](btp_service_key_get_credentials.png)-->
