# Set Up Jupyter Notebook for Service Ticket Intelligence
<!-- description --> Set up a local JupyterLab instance as well as the Jupyter Notebook for Service Ticket Intelligence.

## You will learn
  - How to install Python and Anaconda
  - How to set up a local Jupyter server to run Jupyter notebooks

## Intro
A Jupyter Notebook is used in the following tutorials to make the steps interactive and easy to follow. For more information on Jupyter Notebooks, see [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). The notebooks and datasets used for this tutorial mission are available in this [repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/service-ticket-intelligence-jupyter-notebook).

### Install Anaconda


First, you need to install Anaconda. Anaconda is a platform that offers tools to process large datasets and is often used by data scientists. When installing Anaconda, the programming language Python is installed as well.

To install Anaconda, head over to the [Anaconda installation guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and look for your operating system. Once there, follow the installation guide.

[OPTION BEGIN [Windows]]

To verify the installation, search for `Anaconda Prompt` in your programs and open it. In the command prompt, enter `conda --version` and the version is printed as in the image below.

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Mac and Linux]]

To verify the installation, open a new Terminal or Command Prompt. In the command prompt, enter `conda --version` and the version appears as in the image below.

[OPTION END]

You have successfully installed Anaconda.


### Clone the repository


All you will need throughout the tutorial is within this [repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/service-ticket-intelligence-jupyter-notebook) on GitHub. It includes three Jupyter notebooks, one for each of the use cases of Service Ticket Intelligence, as well as some dataset that can be used. Now, you will clone this repository to your local computer.

[OPTION BEGIN [Windows]]

Open the `Anaconda Prompt` again in case you have closed it. Navigate into the folder where the repository should be placed using the command `cd <path>` or stay where you are. Then, enter the following command to clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/service-ticket-intelligence-jupyter-notebook
```

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Mac and Linux]]

Open a Terminal or Command Prompt again in case you have closed it. Navigate into the folder where the repository should be placed using the command `cd <path>` or stay where you are. Then, enter the following command to clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/service-ticket-intelligence-jupyter-notebook
```

[OPTION END]

Once the repository is cloned, you receive an output as above, saying that it's done.


### Start Jupyter server


To use the Jupyter notebooks, you must have a local instance of the Jupyter server running.

Stay in the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or the Terminal (Mac and Linux) and navigate into the new folder that was created while cloning the repository by using the command `cd service-ticket-intelligence-jupyter-notebook`. You then move into the folder and your current path will change accordingly.

Next, enter the command `jupyter notebook` to start the server.

Once the server started, the Jupyter notebook automatically opens in the browser. In case it does not, you can use one of the URLs that appear in the command prompt.



### Add credentials


Finally, you need to upload the service key file that you obtained in [Use Free Tier to Set Up Account for Service Ticket Intelligence and Get Service Key](cp-aibus-sti-booster-free-key) or [Use Trial to Set Up Account for Service Ticket Intelligence and Get Service Key](cp-aibus-sti-booster-key).

On the Jupyter notebook page that you opened in the previous step, click **Upload**.

![Upload](upload-key-file.png)

In the dialog that opens, select the file that contains the service key.

Finally, edit the file name and update it to `default_key.json`. Click **Upload** again.

Now, the file shows in the list of documents and folders. With that, you are done with the setup and ready for the next tutorial.
