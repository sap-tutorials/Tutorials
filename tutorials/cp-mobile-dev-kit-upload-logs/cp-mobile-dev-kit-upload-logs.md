[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Define client log policy in Mobile Services cockpit )]

SAP Mobile Services provides administrators, developers and support staff with extensive logs and traces functionality to troubleshoot application issues. You can control the amount of information that is captured by setting the log level for individual logging components.

In this step, you will enable client log upload policy in **SAP Mobile Services Cockpit** for a given MDK app.

1. Login to [Mobile Services Cockpit](fiori-ios-hcpms-setup), click `com.sap.mdk.demo` | **Mobile Client Log Upload**.

    !![MDK](img_1.1.png)

2. Check **Log Upload** option and click **Save**.

    >Other policy parameters like Log Level, Delete Uploaded Log After, Maximum Number of Logs and Maximum Log Size currently have no effect.

    >You can find more details about [Client Log Upload feature](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/features/logging/admin/policies.html).

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create log actions)]

Logs help you trace events that occur while your application is running. You can create logging actions, set their priority levels and upload stored log entries.

You will create 3 actions:

* Log action of Type `SetState`: to turn the logger On, Off or Toggle

* Log action of Type `SetLevel`: to set log level (Debug, Info, Warn or Error)

* Log action of Type `Upload`: to upload logs from app to Mobile Services

>You can find more details about [MDK Log Actions](https://help.sap.com/doc/69c2ce3e50454264acf9cafe6c6e442c/Latest/en-US/docs-en/reference/schemadoc/Action/Logger/LogMessage.schema.html).

    Provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Bind Set State log action to success of InitializeOffline action)]

When the metadata is downloaded from App Update, `OnDidUpdate` event is being called which eventually triggers `InitializeOffline.action`. You can look at `Application.app` file for the details.

You will bind `LogSetState.action` at success of  `InitializeOffline.action`.

Navigate to `DemoSampleApp` | `Actions` | `Service` | `InitializeOffline.action` | scroll-down and expand **Common Action Properties** section | click the link icon for **Success Action** and bind it to  `LogSetState.action`
