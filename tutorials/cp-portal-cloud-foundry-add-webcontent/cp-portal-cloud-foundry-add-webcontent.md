# Add Web Content to Your Portal Site and Set the Layout
<!-- description --> Design your Portal site by adding widgets with meaningful content.

## Prerequisites
The `JobCore` Portal site is open in the Pages editor displaying the `JobCore` and `Launchpad` pages.

## You will learn
  - How to add web content to a page in your Portal site
  - How to design the layout of your page and its content

## Intro
By now, you should have created the `JobCore Portal` site with a `Home` page and a `Launchpad` page that are both part of the site menu.

In this tutorial, we will add web content to a Portal page and design its layout and appearance according to a predefined, appealing design.  We are building a Portal site for a recruiting company, so our content will be applicable to this scenario.

Let's add meaningful content to your `Home` page.

> NOTE: if your time is limited, you need only do Steps 2 and 6. The other steps show you additional capabilities but take longer.

### Download resources


Before you start, first download the following images that you will add to your page. To download them, right-click the links and choose **Save link as** and save them on your computer.

  - [`JobCoreLogo.png`](Resources/JobCoreLogo.png)

  -	[`Header_01.jpg`](Resources/Header_01.jpg)

  -	[`Header_02.jpg`](Resources/Header_02.jpg)

  - [`We're_Local.png`](Resources/We're_Local.png)

  - [`We're_experienced.png`](Resources/We're_experienced.png)

  - [`We're_innovative.png`](Resources/We're_innovative.png)

  - [`Explore_JobCore_Services.jpg`](Resources/Explore_JobCore_Services.jpg)

  - [`View_Available_Jobs.jpg`](Resources/View_Available_Jobs.jpg)

  - [`Staying_Connected.jpg`](Resources/Staying_Connected.jpg)




### Add widgets to the page


1. Click the `JobCore` page from the **Pages** panel in the Pages editor.

2. Click the **Header** section of the page -- this is the section with `Menu Item 1, 2, 3`.

    As you click in the page section, editing icons become visible. Since the page template that you selected to create this page contains a menu widget that you don't need for this specific site design, you are going to delete it by simply clicking the **Delete** icon.

    ![Delete menu](18a_delete_existing_menu.png)

3. Click **Delete** on the confirmation dialog.

4. Click the **Header** section again and then click the **+** icon on the right to open the widget gallery.

    ![Edit header section](19_edit_header_section.png)

5. Click the **Headline Carousel** widget from the **Web Content Widgets: Carousel** category.

    >You can also locate this widget in the **Add Widgets** dialog box, by typing the name of the widget (in this case `Headline Carousel`), in the search box and clicking the search icon.

      ![Add new header](20_add_header_widget.png)

6. **Section 1** is the second section in this page that has no widgets in it. Click in this section as seen in the image.

     ![Click Section 1](20a_select_section1.png)

7. Add the following widgets.

    >Note: A section can contain multiple widgets. When you click on a widget, the widget editing icons appear at the top left of the widget, and the section editing icons appear at the top right of the section.

    >Don't worry about the content yet. You'll edit this later. Just keep clicking the **+** icon to add the widgets. You can also use the **Search** feature to find the widgets that you want.

    -	**Header with Titles** from the **Web Content Widgets: Basic** category.

    -	**Aligned Story Card** from the **Web Content Widgets: Cards** category.

8. Scroll down and click in **Section 2** of the page and add these widgets:

    -	**Header with Titles** from the **Web Content Widgets: Basic** category.

    - **Centered Story Card** from the **Web Content Widgets: Cards** category.

9. Click in **Section 3** of the page and add these widgets:

    -	**Image** from the **Web Content Widgets: Basic** category.

    -	**Small Icon Links Card** from the **Web Content Widgets: Cards** category.

You have a page full of widgets that still have their default content. So now let's replace the default content with more meaningful content.


### Add your own content to the site


1. Click the `Headline Carousel` widget from the **Header** section to expose the widget and section editing icons.

2.	Click **Edit content** (the pencil icon in the top left) to edit the content of this widget.

    ![Edit header section](21_edit_header_widget.png)

3. In the left panel, you can see that this widget includes 3 content items (each of which you can edit). Since this is a carousel widget, each content item is a slide in the carousel and each slide includes an image, a title, and a subtitle as content.

    >Note: we will click **Save** at the end of the editing.

4. Click the first content item and edit it as follows:


    |  Field     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Image           | Replace with: `Header_01.jpg` (one of the resource files you downloaded in step 1 above)
    |  Title           | Welcome to JobCore
    |  Content    | Number one global recruiting and staffing company

    ![Change content](22_change_content.png)

5. Click the second content item and edit as follows:


    |  Field      | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    | Image           | `Header_02.jpg`
    |  Title           | Let us help YOU!
    |  Content    | We are focused on helping you find the right candidates faster. We guarantee higher response rates with long term employer-employee relationships. Let us help you find your next successful employee.


6. The carousel that we want for our site only has 2 slides, so you can delete the third content item. Click the third content item and then click the minus sign at the bottom of the screen to delete it.

    ![Delete content item](22a_delete_content_item.png)

7. Click **Save**.

8. You're now going to edit the content in the next section of the page. In **Section 1** click in the **Header with Titles** widget to expose the editing icons.

9. Click **Edit content** (pencil icon) and edit the widget as follows:

    |  Field     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------

    **Section 3** should look like this:

    ![View Section 3](24c_view_section3.png)

You've replaced all the default content in the widgets with your own. Let's arrange the widgets on the page.



### Design the sections of your page


In this step, you'll arrange the widgets in the different sections of the page and configure the visual settings of the sections (like minimum height).


1. Click in **Section 1** or on any widget in this section, to expose the editing icons for this section.

2. Click the **Edit section settings** icon on the right.

    ![Edit section settings](27_edit_section_settings.png)

3. Edit the settings for **Section 1** as follows:

    - Check that the order of the widgets are according to how you want them to appear on your page. If they're not, simply hover over the grip control next to the widget name and drag it to the right place.

        ![Arrange widget order](28_drag_drop.png)

      - In the **Layout** tab, select the **Column** layout. We are choosing this layout option because we want our widgets to be arranged one under the other and we want each widget to take up the whole width of the screen.  

        ![Select a layout](29_select_layout.png)

      - In the **Dimensions** tab, edit the settings as follows:

        |  Dimensions    | Value
        |  :------------- | :-------------
        |  Margins           | 5 `px`
        |  Content Width           | Full
        |  Minimum Height    | Default

        Click **Save**.

        ![Set dimensions](30_set_dimensions.png)


4. Click in page **Section 2** to highlight the **Edit sections** icon on the right and edit the settings as follows:

    -	Check that the order of the widgets are according to how you want them to appear on your page.

    -	In the **Layout** tab, select the **Column** layout.

    -	In the **Dimensions** tab, edit the settings as follows:


    |  Dimentions     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Margins           | 5 `px`
    |  Content Width           | Full
    |  Minimum Height    | Default


      Click **Save**.

5. Click in page **Section 3** to highlight the **Edit sections** icon on the right and edit the settings as follows:

    -	Check that the order of the widgets are according to how you want them to appear on your page.

    -	In the **Layouts** tab, select **Custom**. We are choosing this layout option so that we can determine how much of the screen each widget will take up. For our site we want to arrange the widgets as follows:

        Under the desktop icon, enter ¼ for the **Image** widget and ¾ for the **Small Icon Links Card**.  This means that the **Image** widget will take up one quarter of the width of the screen and the **Small Icon Links Card** widget will take up the rest.

        ![Layout for section 4](33_section4_layout.png)

    -	In the **Dimensions** tab, change the settings as follows:

    |  Dimensions     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Margins           | 100 `px`
    |  Content Width           | 1366 `px`
    |  Minimum Height    | Default

  Click **Save**.

You've now designed your Portal page by arranging the widgets in their page sections. In the next step you'll change the dimensions of the actual widget so that they are visually aligned and displayed effectively on your page.


### Configure the layout of the widgets


In this step, you are going to change the widget settings of the following widgets:

>Note that you can also change how you want your widget displayed -- as a card, list, grid, or carousel.

 1. Click the **Aligned Story Card** widget in **Section 1**.

 2. Click **Settings** (cog icon) at the top of the section.

    ![Define widget settings](31_widget_settings.png)

3. Change the dimensions as follows and then click **Save**.

    |  Dimension     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Item Height           | 27 rem
    |  Item Width           | 18 rem
    |  Margins    | 4 rem
    |  Alignment          | Center


    ![Enter setting values](32_enter_settings.png)

4. Click the **Centered Story Card** widget in **Section 2** and then click **Settings** (cog icon). Change the dimensions as follows and then click **Save**.


    |  Field Name     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Item Height           | 30 rem
    |  Item Width           | 20 rem
    |  Margins    | 4 rem
    |  Alignment          | Center


5. Click the **Small Icons Link Card** in **Section 3** and then click **Settings** (cog icon). Change the dimensions as follows and then click **Save**.

    | Dimension     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Item Height           | 20 rem
    |  Item Width           | 275 `px`
    |  Margins              | 0 rem
    |  Alignment          | Center




### Review your site


Now that your page is ready, you may want to take a look at how your users will see the site so far. Click the **Go to site** icon at the top right of the screen.

![Go to site](34_go_to_site.png)

And this is what you'll see:

![View site](35_view_site.png)

Congratulations!  You've created a very attractive `Home` page. In our next tutorial, we're going to add a URL app to our `Launchpad` page.
