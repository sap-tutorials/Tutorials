- This is the third tutorial of group [Create a SAP Fiori based Table Maintenance app](group.abap-env-factory). You must complete the tutorials in the given order.

## You will learn  
- How to use the Custom Business Configurations app to maintain configurations


## Intro
The [**Custom Business Configurations**](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/76384d8e68e646d6ae5ce8977412cbb4.html) app serves as an entry point to the configuration objects provided by different applications or partners. You can use the app to adjust these configuration objects to change and influence the system behavior.

The required business catalog is contained in business role template `SAP_BR_BPC_EXPERT (Configuration Expert - Business Process Configuration)`. Ensure the user responsible for maintaining the error codes has this role assigned.

>**Hint:** The trial user in SAP BTP ABAP trial system already has the required catalog.

>You can manage your customizing transports with the [**Export Customizing Transport**](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/fa7366c3888848bd94566104ac52e627.html) app

>Business Configuration content can be recorded on both software components of type `Business Configuration` or `Development`. The former is recommended, see also [Business Configuration for SAP Cloud Platform ABAP Environment | SAP Blogs](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/12/20/business-configuration-for-sap-cloud-platform-abap-environment/). The transport request must have the attribute `SAP_ATO_TRANSPORT_TYPE` set to `BC` and the attribute `SAP_CUS_TRANSPORT_CATEGORY` set to `DEFAULT_CUST` or `MANUAL_CUST`.
