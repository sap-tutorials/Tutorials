## Prerequisites
 - **Tutorials:**  You have completed [Import the OVA](hxe-ua-ova-vm) 

## You will learn
You'll learn how to start the VM, change the VM default keyboard layout, and change the default time zone.

## Intro
If you don't change the keyboard layout to match the physical keyboard of your host machine (referred to as your **laptop** in this documentation), you may encounter problems later when logging in.

### Start your VM


Open your hypervisor application.

Power on (or click *Play* on) your SAP HANA 2.0, express edition VM.

### Change the keyboard layout if your laptop doesn't use an English (US) keyboard


The system prompts you to either change the VM keyboard, or accept the default English (US) QWERTY keyboard. Enter `Y` to change the keyboard or `N` to use the default.
