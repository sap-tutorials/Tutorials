    - This button can be found in all planning applications which have a cost table and is always located on the top-right corner of the cost table.
    - By pressing this button, a recalculation of costs is started. This is necessary when you adjust your headcount or FTE numbers as costs do not automatically refresh after adjusting the headcount or FTE values.

### Pre-configuration of Planning Applications
Before going into the planning applications, you need to make some foundational settings required for the planning activities in the data modeler first.

This is because some of the properties maintained in the data modeler are used for the correct initialization of the planning applications and the widgets inside of them. Making these settings beforehand is highly recommended, so your planning process will not be disrupted by jumping back and forth between the applications and the data modeler.

In this step you will learn which settings must be configured outside the applications in case you do not want to go with the default settings and how this is done. This includes changing the span of the plan horizon (Tab 1), defining the reference period used for the data seeding algorithms (Tab 2), changing the Plan Level (Tab 3) and other possible modifications (Tab 4).

[OPTION BEGIN [Define Planning Horizon]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Define Planning Horizon**. This tab provides guidance on how to change or define the periods you want to do your planning on.

>INFORMATION:
>
- The term **planning horizon** describes the amount of periods you want to look into the future when preparing your operational plan.
- Per default, the planning horizon is configured to range over a span of 12 periods, starting from period `01.2023` up until period `12.2023`.
- If you want to change the configuration of the planning horizon (for instance because you want to plan more than 12 periods to the future), you can accomplish it by making some slight modifications in the properties of the **Version** dimension.
- By doing that, all the planning tables inside the different planning applications will initialize according to your new definition.


1. Open the HXM Workforce Planning data model

    - In the SAP Analytics Cloud menu, navigate to the **Files** section
    - Look for the HXM Workforce Planning data model by entering the term `SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WORKFORCE` into the search bar
    - Click on the file to open the data model

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/1.png)

2. Open the **Version** dimension

    - In the data modeler, scroll down to the dimension list and click on the dimension **Version** to modify it

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/2.png)

3. Adjust your planning horizon by changing the properties

    - The planning horizon for the different versions is defined by the properties **Start Period of Planning** and **End Period of Planning**.
    - The property **Start Period of Planning** defines the first period of the planning horizon, while the property **End Period of Planning** defines the last period of the planning horizon.
    - In the screenshot shown below, the planning horizon for each of the versions ranges from the period `01.2023` to `12.2023` for instance. As a result, all planning tables inside the planning applications will range from period `01.2023` to period `12.2023`.
    - If you intend to change the span of the planning horizon, please make sure to enter the new period values in a `YYYYMM` format.
    - Please note that the planning horizon must always be a multiple of 12 (for instance ranging over 12,24,36 periods etc.)

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/3.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - In this tutorial, the planning horizon will not be changed and all upcoming steps are based on the default configuration shown in the above screenshot
    - If you still want to change the planning horizon, please do so for the versions `public.Aggregated_Plan` and `public.Detailed_Plan` as these versions are set as the default plan versions for the applications.

4. Save your changes

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Define Reference Period]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Define Reference Period**. This tab provides guidance on how to define the reference period used for your data seeding algorithms.

>INFORMATION:
>
- The **reference period** represents one specific period containing historical actual data, which is used by different data seeding algorithms
- In the scope of this content package, there are two data seeding algorithms which are based on this reference period. One of the algorithms is used to derive midpoint salaries, while the other one is used to pre-fill the plan versions with headcount data. Both of the algorithms take the actual data from the reference period and perform data preparation steps on it. More information about these algorithms can be found in the step **Application Configuration**.
- Per default, the reference period is set to the period `12.2022`. This means that your midpoint salaries will be derived based on your `12.2022` actual salary data or respectively that the periods of your planning horizon will be populated based on your `12.2022` headcount data
- If you want to change the configuration of the reference period (for instance because you want to use another period as a baseline), you can do so by modifying a property in the **Version** dimension
- By doing that, the seeding algorithms will use your newly defined reference period as a baseline for pre-populating the affected tables

1. Open the HXM Workforce Planning data model

    - In the SAP Analytics Cloud menu, navigate to the **Files** section
    - Look for the HXM Workforce Planning data model by entering the term `SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WORKFORCE` into the search bar
    - Click on the file to open the data model

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/1.png)

2. Open the **Version** dimension

    - In the data modeler, scroll down to the dimension list and click on the dimension **Version** to modify it

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/2.png)

3. Adjust your reference period by changing the property

    - The reference period used for the seeding algorithms is defined by the property **Reference Period for Seeding**.
    - In the screenshot shown below, the reference period for each of the versions is set to the period `12.2022`. As a result, the seeding algorithms based on this property will take the actual data of the period `12.2022` as a baseline.
    - If you intend to change the reference period, please make sure to enter the new period value in a `YYYYMM` format.
    - Please note that the reference period must contain actual data.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/4.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - In this tutorial, the reference period will not be changed and all upcoming steps are based on the default configuration shown in the above screenshot
    - If you still want to change the reference period, please do so for the versions `public.Aggregated_Plan` and `public.Detailed_Plan` as these versions are set as the default plan versions for the applications

4. Save your changes

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Define Plan Level]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Define Plan Level**. This tab provides guidance on how to select the Plan Level used for your planning activities.

>INFORMATION:
>
In the scope of this content package, the term **Plan Level** describes the high level point of view which is used by the planner for the planning activities.
>
Per default, the content package comes with five pre-defined Plan Levels, between which you can choose.
>
- The pre-defined Plan Level **PL1** enables the planner to perform planning activities on a `Company Code + Business Unit` aggregation level and is meant to be used in the aggregated planning scenario.
- The pre-defined Plan Level **PL2** enables the planner to perform planning activities on a `Company Code + Business Unit + Division` aggregation level and is meant to be used in the aggregated planning scenario.
- The pre-defined Plan Levels **PL3** and **PL4** enable the planner to perform planning activities on a `Company Code + Cost Center` aggregation level. While Plan Level **PL3** and Plan Level **PL4** provide the same point of view, **PL3** is used for the aggregated planning scenario while **PL4** is used for the detailed planning scenario.
- The pre-defined Plan Level **PL5** enables the planner to perform planning activities on a `Company Code + Business Unit + Job Family` aggregation level and is meant to be used in the aggregated planning scenario.
>
Throughout the entire planning process, planning can only be done on one Plan Level. Thus you need to decide carefully on which dimensions you want to enter your planning assumptions on.
>
If you decide to do your planning on a `Company Code + Business Unit` level for example, you would need to configure the Plan Level **PL1** as your default Plan Level in the **Version** dimension.
>
By doing that, all the planning tables inside the different applications will initialize according to your settings.
>
For more information about the term **Plan Level**, how to create and use new ones, or how to adjust existing ones, please check out the tutorial [xP&A HXM Workforce Planning - Add a new Plan Level](xpa-sac-hxm-add-plan-level)


1. Open the HXM Workforce Planning data model

    - In the SAP Analytics Cloud menu, navigate to the **Files** section
    - Look for the HXM Workforce Planning data model by entering the term `SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WORKFORCE` into the search bar
    - Click on the file to open the data model

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/1.png)

2. Open the **Version** dimension

    - In the data modeler, scroll down to the dimension list and click on the dimension **Version** to modify it

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/2.png)

3. Adjust your Plan Level by changing the property

    - The Plan Level configured for the different versions is defined by the property **Plan Level**.
    - In the screenshot shown below, the Plan Level for the version `public.Aggregated_Plan` for instance is set to `PL3`. As a result, all tables of the planning applications using this version will allow you to make entries on a `Company Code + Cost Center` level.
    - If you wanted to do your planning on a `Company Code + Business Unit` level, you would need to change the property from `PL3` to `PL1`
    - Please make sure to enter the technical ID of a valid member of the **Plan Level** dimension when changing the Plan Level (e.g. `PL1`, `PL2`, etc.).


    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/5.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - In this tutorial, the Plan Level will not be changed and all upcoming steps are based on the default configuration shown in the above screenshot
    - If you still want to change the Plan Level, please do so for the versions `public.Aggregated_Plan` and `public.Detailed_Plan` as these versions are set as the default plan versions for the applications.

4. Save your changes

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Other Modifications]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Other Modifications**. This tab provides information about additional customization options.

1. **Visibility of Versions inside the Planning Applications**

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - Some of the planning applications, such as the **Application Configuration** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_CENTRAL_ASSUMPTIONS`) allow you to select the version you want to work on from inside the application by using a drop down window
    - The versions you can select inside the applications are not selectable per default though. In order to make the versions selectable, you need to mark them inside the data modeler.
    - This can be very useful if you want to deliberately hide certain versions from being modified or if you create your own versions

    - In order to define which version you want to make selectable, enter the **Version** dimension inside the data modeler and modify the property **Is Version Visible?**
    - An `x` indicates that the version will be added to the selection drop down inside the planning applications. A blank cell indicates that the version will not be added to the selection widgets.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/6.png)

2. **Planning Direction of Versions**

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - You may have noticed that the **Version** dimension contains one last property called **Planning Direction**
    - This property indicates whether the version is used for the aggregated planning scenario or the detailed planning scenario
    - The aggregated planning scenario is covered by the applications **Aggregated Internal HC Plan** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_AGGREGATED_INTERNAL`) and **Aggregated External HC Plan** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_AGGREGATED_EXTERNAL`), while the detailed planning scenario is covered by the application **Detailed Internal FTE Plan** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_DETAILED_INTERNAL`)
    - This property needs to be maintained in order to initialize the planning applications correctly

    - In order to define which version represents which planning scenario, enter the **Version** dimension inside the data modeler and modify the property **Planning Direction**
    - Allowed entries are `Aggregated`, `Detailed` or blank.
    - The property `Aggregated` indicates that the version is used for the aggregated planning scenario, while `Detailed` is used for the detailed planning scenario. A blank cell indicates that this version is not relevant for any of those scenarios, i.e. because it is just a backup version or a temporary version for any kind of activity.

3. **Planning Direction of Plan Levels**

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - Similar to the **Version** dimension, the **Plan Level** dimension also contains a property called **Planning Direction**
    - This property indicates whether the Plan Level is used for the aggregated planning scenario or the detailed planning scenario
    - As per default definition, you can see that all pre-defined Plan Levels apart from `PL4` are categorized as `Aggregated` while `PL4` itself is categorized as `Detailed`
    - This property needs to be maintained in case you want to change the definition of the Plan Levels or when you add new ones

    - In order to map the Plan Levels to the aggregated planning scenario or the detailed planning scenario, enter the **Plan Level** dimension inside the data modeler and modify the property **Planning Direction**
    - Make sure to enter either the value `Detailed` or `Aggregated` for each of the members

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/8.png)

4. **Definition of Plan Levels**

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - In the **Plan Level** dimension, you can find a property called **Plan Dimensions**
    - This property defines which dimensions are covered by the different Plan Levels
    - Per default, each Plan Level contains the **Company Code** dimension automatically. Thus it must not be specified here.
    - If you wanted to do your planning on a `Company Code + Cost Center` level, you would need to add the term `costCenter` into the **Plan Dimensions** property of the respective Plan Level, as it is the case for the Element-ID `PL3`.

    - In order to learn how to maintain this property correctly and how to change or create a new Plan Level, check out the tutorial [xP&A HXM Workforce Planning - Add a new Plan Level](xpa-sac-hxm-add-plan-level)

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/9.png)

5. **Maintenance of G/L Accounts for Financial Integration**

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - In order to integrate the final results from your workforce plan into your financial plans, you need to establish a mapping between the members of the **Cost Type** dimension and the members of the **G/L Account** dimension.
    - This can be done by modifying the `GL_Account` property of the **Cost Type** dimension
    - If you do not maintain a valid mapping between those two entities, you will not be able to transfer your results to your financial plan

    - Enter the **Cost Type** dimension (`SAP_HR_COSTTYPE`) inside the data modeler
    - For each leaf member of the dimension, enter a valid G/L account number into the GL account property (`GL_Account`)
    - Make sure that the G/L account number you enter is a valid member of the public G/L account dimension `SAP_FI_IFP_GLACCOUNT`

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](11/10.png)

6. **Creation and Usage of own Versions**

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - This content packages comes with a couple of pre-defined plan versions
    - Per default, the version `public.Aggregated_Plan` is utilized in the applications **Aggregated Internal HC Plan** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_AGGREGATED_INTERNAL`) and **Aggregated External HC Plan** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_AGGREGATED_EXTERNAL`) representing the aggregated planning scenario
    - The version `public.Detailed_Plan` is used in the application **Detailed Internal FTE Plan** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_DETAILED_INTERNAL`) representing the bottom-up planning scenario
    - The other applications allow you to select between one of these pre-defined versions
    - If you want to use your own version, you need to create one beforehand

    - Find out how to create a new version in the tutorial [xP&A HXM Workforce Planning - Add a new Version](xpa-sac-hxm-add-new-version)

### Application Configuration
Now that you are familiar with the basics and the navigation concept, you will learn in more detail how to use the different planning applications.

This step focuses on the **Application Configuration** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_CENTRAL_ASSUMPTIONS`) application.

You will learn how to open the application (Tab 1), how to setup the parameters and the planning baseline (Tab 2) and how to populate the pre-delivered versions with plan data (Tab 3).

If you are interested in a short demo visualizing all of this, please check out the following video **Operational Workforce Planning: Configuration**:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=i3WhieHL9mE" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/dEoAIftKdfw/0.jpg" alt="xP&A HXM Workforce Planning" width="540" height="300" border="2" /></a>

[OPTION BEGIN [Open Application]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Open Application**. This tab provides guidance on how to open the **Application Configuration** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_CENTRAL_ASSUMPTIONS`) application.

1. In the **Overview Page** application, click on the **Application Configuration** link

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/1.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - The **Application Configuration** planning application serves as a central place to set up cost parameters for each of the pre-defined cost types and versions
    - Maintaining those cost parameters is an important part of the planning process as all cost estimations are based on the entries made inside the application
    - Furthermore it provides you with the possibility to pre-populate and initialize the plan versions with headcount and cost data
    - In order to do so, you can choose between two seeding algorithms. You can either select one period and use this period as a reference for populating all plan periods, or run a machine learning algorithm based on historical data for a more dynamic approach


2. Get an overview of the application

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning Overview](5/2.png)

    - Make yourself familiar with the application
    - Try to identity the different buttons and elements presented in the previous step

3. Check the **Steps** section

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/3.png)

    - All planning applications provide a short in-built step by step guide which helps you to use the corresponding application correctly
    - Before using the application, make sure to check the **Steps** description field to understand the intended workflow

You may now switch to the second tab **Setup Application**.

[OPTION END]


[OPTION BEGIN [Setup Application]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Setup Application**. This tab provides guidance on how to setup the planning baseline and the cost parameters.

1. Click on the **Guide Me!** button to start with the planning process

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/4.png)

    - As suggested in the **Steps** description field, start the planning process by pressing on the **Guide Me!** button
    - This button opens a pop-up which guides you through the setup process and helps you to decide between different options to maintain your cost parameters


2. Select the version you want to plan on

    <!-- border; size:350px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/5.png)

    - In the tab **Step 1: General Settings** of the pop-up, you can decide which version you want to do your planning on
    - Choose either the version `Aggregated_Plan` if you want to plan on an aggregated level or `Detailed_Plan` if you want to plan on an employee level

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - Per default, the version `Aggregated_Plan` is utilized in the applications **Aggregated Internal HC Plan** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_AGGREGATED_INTERNAL`) and **Aggregated External HC Plan** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_AGGREGATED_EXTERNAL`), while the version `Detailed_Plan` is used in the application **Detailed Internal FTE Plan** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_DETAILED_INTERNAL`)
    - If you want to use your own version, you need to create one beforehand. Find out how to create a new version in the tutorial [xP&A HXM Workforce Planning - Add a new Version](xpa-sac-hxm-add-new-version)

3. Change the Plan Level if required

    - Furthermore you can see which **Plan Level** is currently configured in the same tab inside the pop-up
    - In this specific example, the Plan Level is set to `Company Code + Cost Center`, which means that you will do your planning on a company code and cost center level
    - If you want to change your Plan Level, you can do so by modifying the **Plan Level** property of the **Version** dimension inside the data modeler. Please refer to the step **Pre-configuration of Planning Applications** in order to look up how to change the Plan Level.

4. Decide for a method to load the data in

    <!-- border; size:350px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/8.png)

    - Switch over to the second tab **Step 2: Data Input** of the pop-up
    - Here you can select between three different modes to load your central assumptions
    - The mode **Manual** will not perform any calculation as it indicates that you want to upload the data manually. In the tutorial [xP&A HXM Workforce Planning - Create and Upload Central Assumptions](xpa-sac-hxm-maintain-central-assumptions) you can learn how to manually create and upload these cost parameters.
    - The mode **Derive Midpoint Salaries** will derive the midpoint salaries based on a reference period. The remaining cost parameters, such as the bonus rate, travel costs etc. must be entered manually afterwards.
    - The mode **Copy Data From** allows you to copy central assumptions from another version. This is useful in case you have already maintained your central assumptions on another version.
    - Click `Done` to close the dialogue

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - When deriving midpoint salaries, make sure you have a reference period maintained in the **Reference Period for Seeding** property of the **Version** dimension for your specific version
    - Also make sure you have your plan horizon set up correctly. You can do so by modifying the properties **Start Period of Planning** and **End Period of Planning** for your specific version inside the **Version** dimension.
    - This seeding algorithm will take the base salaries of the defined reference period, aggregate them to the dimensions of the specified Plan Level and form an average to derive the midpoint salaries for each existing combination of `Company Code` and `Cost Center` (representing Plan Level `PL3`).
    - Afterwards this result will be used to pre-populate the midpoint salary measure for your central assumptions, while the results are written to the periods covered by your defined plan horizon

    - You can now also perform changes on your data inside the planning table

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/10.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - There are three kind of measures that are maintained in the Central Assumptions
    - The midpoint salary represents the average salary for a new hire. Thus, please make sure to enter an absolute value here.
    - Percent rates like the **Bonus (%)** or the **Health Insurance (%)** represent percentage values. These are multiplied with the monthly salary of an existing employee or the midpoint salary in case of a new hire.
    - Absolute rates like **travel costs** are absolute per capita rates and are added to the total costs during the cost calculations. Please make sure to provide an absolute value here as well.

5. Change the planning mode from **Internal Workforce** to **External Workforce**

    The content package provides you with the opportunity to not only plan costs for internal workforce, but also for external workforce.

    As the input table for external workforce is structured slightly different from the one used for internal workforce, you need to change the input mode inside the application.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/11.png)

    - Click on the button **External Workforce** located on the top-left corner
    - The application will now restructure the layout and the planning table accordingly




 6. Set up parameters for external workforce

    - In general, the maintenance of cost parameters for external workforce is the same as for internal workforce
    - The only difference is that for external workforce, only one cost parameter is available, which is the monthly average cost rate `Cost Rate For External Workers`. Make sure to enter an absolute value here.
    - Furthermore, the location dimension as mandatory dimension for external workforce is automatically added in addition to the dimensions defined by the Plan Level

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/12.png)

Now that you have set everything up, you can publish your data and pre-populate your plan version with plan data. You can now switch to the tab **Publish and Populate Version**.

[OPTION END]


[OPTION BEGIN [Publish and Populate Version]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Publish and Populate Version**. This tab provides guidance on how to publish your entries and pre-populate your plan version.

1. Press on the **Confirm** button

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/13.png)

    - If you have finished maintaining the cost parameters and would like to publish them, you can do so by pressing on the **Confirm** button.
    - Hitting this button also provides you with the possibility to initialize your plan version and pre-populate the plan periods with headcount and cost data.

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - By publishing the version, all other users will be able to see your edits in the version you were working on (in case they have sufficient rights to view the respective data slices of course)
    - As soon as you start editing a public version, a private version is created in the background, which only you can see. All edits you do, are done on this private version. Thus your work-in-progress is only visible to you.
    - It is possible to leave the application and resume your work on another day without losing your progress
    - Only after publishing the version, your changes will be written to the public version and will be visible to all other users
    - Not publishing your data would result in other users not being able to retrieve the cost parameters for their cost calculations in this scenario.  
    - Learn more about the concept of planning on public versions in our [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/b6e3d093988e4c3eba7eb6c1c110e954.html?q=version)

2. Check your selection for correctness
    - In the pop-up, check whether your current selection is correct
    - If this is the case, your data will be published on the displayed version and Plan Level.

3. Enable the toggle switch **Initialize Plan Data After Publish**

    <!-- border; size:300px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/14.png)

    - By enabling the toggle switch `Initialize Plan Data After Publish`, your plan version will also be pre-populated with headcount and cost data (in case central assumptions for the given plan level are maintained). The headcount and cost data will be visible in the tables of the other planning applications, which will be introduced in the next steps of this tutorial.
    - If you do not enable this toggle switch, only your edits for the central assumptions will be made visible. The headcount and cost planning tables inside the other planning applications will not be filled with data.

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - Disabling the toggle switch generally only makes sense if you have already started with your planning but need to adjust a cost rate for a specific company code mid planning for example. This way, your progress will not be overwritten when publishing your changes in the central assumptions.
    - When initially starting the planning process on the other hand, is recommended to enable the toggle switch. By doing so, you will already have pre-filled planning tables where you only need to make some slight adjustments instead of filling it with data manually from scratch.
    - The pre-population algorithm for the initialization takes the actual headcount data from the defined **reference period**, aggregates it to the dimensions of the selected **Plan Level** and copies the results to the periods of the defined **planning horizon**. For the cost estimation, the cost parameters from the central assumptions are taken. Please note that for existing headcount, the actual base salary is taken for the calculation of the salaries, while for new headcount the midpoint salaries are taken as a baseline
    - Both the reference period as well as the planning horizon can be modified by changing the properties of the **Version** dimension in the data modeler
    - Please note that the pre-population should only be executed on one combination of **Version** and **Plan Level** as otherwise, values will be duplicated in the comparison charts and reporting stories

4. Enable the toggle switch **Use Predictive**

    <!-- border; size:300px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/16.png)

    - By turning on this switch, a machine learning algorithm will be executed in addition to the reference period based pre-population algorithm, which will write the results on a pre-defined version called `Smart_Predict`
    - This version can later be displayed in the planning applications and used as a reference when entering your planning assumptions

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - Please note that this function is only available for the aggregated planning scenario
    - In order to be able to use this function, you must furthermore enable the Smart Predict capabilities beforehand
    - Please check out the tutorial [xP&A HXM Workforce Planning - Create Predictive Scenario](xpa-sac-hxm-create-predictive-scenario) to learn how to enable those capabilities.

5. Confirm your selection

    - In the pop-up, press on the button `OK`
    - Click on the Multi Action trigger to start the pre-population process

    <!-- border; size:300px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/17.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    If the toggle **Use Predictive** is disabled, the pre-population will start immediately after clicking on the `OK` button of the pop-up

[OPTION END]

### Aggregated Internal HC Plan
As you have now maintained all relevant cost parameters and pre-populated the plan version with plan data, you can continue with the actual planning activities.

In this step, the **Aggregated Internal HC Plan** application of this content package is introduced.

You will learn how to open the planning application (Tab 1) and how to maintain plan values for your internal workforce by entering the total headcount demand (Tab 2) or alternatively by planning the amount of hires and terminations (Tab 3).

If you are interested in a short video demonstrating all of this, please check out the following content:

2. Click on the link **Aggregated Internal HC Plan** located inside the **Plan FTE Demands and Costs** section

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](6/1.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - This application allows you to perform planning activities on an aggregated level for internal workforce.
    - You can either plan the total headcount (amount of hires and terminations will then be automatically calculated), or plan the amount of new hires and terminations (total headcount will then be automatically calculated)

3. Get an overview of the application

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](6/2.png)

    - The application consists three sections. In the top section (header section), you can find a high level reporting area where you can compare your current plan version with other versions.
    - In the middle of the screen, you can see the headcount planning table. Here you can enter headcount values on an aggregated level.
    - In the lower section you can find a cost table where you can view the calculated costs as well as make manual adjustments.
    - The tables initialize automatically based on the configuration of the **Plan Level** property of the **Version** dimension.

You may now switch to the second tab **Enter Plan Data : Total Headcount** or to the third tab **Enter Plan Data : Delta Headcount** to learn how to enter your planning assumptions.

[OPTION END]


[OPTION BEGIN [Enter Plan Data : Total Headcount]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Enter Plan Data : Total Headcount**. This tab provides guidance on how to plan headcount values (by entering the total headcount), how to calculate and adjust costs and how to use the version management.


1. Adjust headcount values in the headcount planning table

    - According to the **Steps** description field, start your activities by adjusting your headcount values
    - You may adjust the headcount values separately in each cell, or make use of the drag and drop functionality in order to speed up your process

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](6/3.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - The headcount values shown in the table are calculated by the pre-population algorithm which was triggered in the **Application Configuration** application
    - If you additionally enabled the Smart Predict based pre-population in the seeding step, you can also display the machine learning results by enabling the toggle switch **Show Smart Predict Reference** located on the top-right corner of the planning table. Please note that this toggle switch will only be visible, if Smart Predict capabilities have been activated.

    - In case Smart Predict capabilities have been activated, enable the toggle switch **Show Smart Predict Reference** to display the machine learning based results. These can be taken as a reference for your planning assumptions.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](6/4.png)

2. Recalculate costs

    - Click on the button **Calculate Costs** located on the top-right corner of the cost table

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - As you changed your headcount values, the pre-calculated costs in the lower table do not match with the planned headcount values anymore
    - Thus you need to trigger a recalculation in order to refresh the numbers.



3. Enter additional costs for the internal workforce

    - Click on the toggle switch **Show Adjustment**
    - Enter additional costs in the `Adjustment` column

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](6/5.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - By enabling the toggle switch **Show Adjustment**, you can display an additional column for entering manual adjustments which are added on top to the calculated costs
    - This is useful as the calculated costs are based on the maintained central assumptions and thus only represent a rough estimation of expected costs


4. Publish or revert your version

    - Click on the **Confirm** or **Reset** button in order to publish or revert your plan data

>INFORMATION:
>
- This tab provided guidance on how to plan your headcount by entering the total headcount, while the tab **Enter Plan Data : Delta Headcount** shows how to plan headcount by planning the amount of hires and terminations.
- During the planning process, you can switch back and forth between the different entry modes
- Be aware that the respective measures such as the delta hires and terminations or respectively the end of period headcount values need to be re-calculated when switching the modes. This happens automatically.

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Enter Plan Data : Delta Headcount]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Enter Plan Data : Delta Headcount**. This tab provides guidance on how to plan headcount values (by planning the amount of new hires and terminations), how to calculate and adjust costs and how to use the version management.

1. Enter the mode for the delta planning

    - Click on the **Plan New Hires Demand** button located on the top-left corner of the application **Aggregated Internal HC Plan**

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](6/6.png)

    >
    - The table layout changes accordingly so you can enter the amount of new hires and terminations instead of entering the total headcount amount

2. Enter or adjust the pre-calculated amount of hires and terminations

    - Enter your desired delta values in the rows **Hires (HC)** and **Terminations (HC)** for a particular period

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - In the delta planning mode, please enter the values only into the period in which a hiring or termination should take place
    - The application automatically recalculates the total headcount for this period (see next sub-step) and carries forward the result until the end of the defined plan horizon
    - Thus you do not need to maintain the values in each period, but only in the periods in which the hiring or termination occurs
    - Please note that when entering a termination, it does not matter whether the algebraic sign used is positive or negative. That means you can enter a termination as `-1` or as `1`.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](6/7.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - The headcount values shown in the table are calculated by the pre-population algorithm which was triggered in the **Application Configuration** application

2. Recalculate the costs

    - Click on the button **Calculate Costs** located on the top-right corner of the cost table

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - As you changed your headcount values, the pre-calculated costs in the lower table do not match with the planned headcount values anymore
    - Thus you need to trigger a re-calculation. You can do so by pressing on the **Calculate Costs** button located on the top-right corner of the cost table

3. Enter additional costs for the external workforce

    - Click on the toggle switch **Show Adjustment**
    - Enter additional costs in the `Adjustment` column

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](7/5.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - By enabling the toggle switch **Show Adjustment**, you can display an additional column for entering manual adjustments which are added on top to the calculated costs
    - This is useful as the calculated costs are based on the maintained central assumptions and thus only represent a rough estimation of expected costs

4. Publish or revert your version

    - Click on the **Confirm** or **Reset** button in order to publish or revert your plan data

### Prepare Result for Financial Plan for SAP S/4HANA
After you have completed your workforce planning, you can extend the value of this xP&A scenario by integrating the results into your financial plans.

In this step, you will learn how to open the financial integration preparation application (Tab 1), how to prepare your data for the financial integration (Tab 2) and how to transfer the costs into the **Operating Expense** data model from the [Integrated Financial Planning content package](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/21868089d6ae4c5ab55f599c691726be/7b8caa06f850453fab8d570be92f4c99.html?locale=en-US) (Tab 3).

[OPTION BEGIN [Open Application]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Open Application**. This tab provides guidance on how to open the **Prepare Result for Financial Plan for SAP S/4HANA** (`SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_PREPARE_IFP`) application.

1. Navigate back to the overview application `SAP__HR_BPL_IM_WFP_OVERVIEW_PAGE` by clicking on the **Home** icon on the top left corner of the previously opened planning application.

2. Click on the **Prepare Result For Financial Plan For SAP S/4HANA** link located inside the **Plan FTE Demands & Costs** section

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](9/1.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - This application helps you to prepare your plan data for the financial integration into the **Operating Expense** data model. For more information please relate to the [Integrated Financial Planning for SAP S/4HANA and S/4HANA Cloud](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/21868089d6ae4c5ab55f599c691726be/7b8caa06f850453fab8d570be92f4c99.html?locale=en-US) section in our help portal.
    - In order to prepare the data for the integration, the costs maintained on the different cost types need to be written to their corresponding G/L accounts. This happens via a Data Action, while the results are stored on a separate version called `HXM`.


3. Get an overview of the application

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Workforce Planning](9/2.png)

    - In general the application consists of two sections. In the upper table, you can find your original plan version with all your plan data.
    - In the lower table, you can find the results after having mapped the costs from the cost types to the G/L accounts.
    - In order to ensure a successful derivation of G/L accounts, please maintain the corresponding account numbers in the property `GL_Account` inside the dimension **Plan Cost Type** (`SAP_HR_COSTTYPE`) in the data model as described in the step **Pre-configuration of Planning Applications** of this tutorial.
    - Please note that independent of the Plan Level selected, both of the tables will show your data on a `CompanyCode + CostCenter` level. This is because the **Operating Expense** data model does not have any SuccessFactors specific dimensions such as the **Business Unit** or **Division** dimension. If you did your planning on a `CompanyCode + BusinessUnit` level for instance (not covering the cost center perspective), your costs will be mapped to unassigned member of the **Cost Center** dimension. In order to establish a mapping or distribution to existing cost centers, you must create a suitable derivation logic by yourself in this case.
