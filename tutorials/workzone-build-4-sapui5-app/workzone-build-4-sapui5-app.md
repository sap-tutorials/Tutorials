## Prerequisites
 - You've already designed the **Home** page where you'll add this app.   



## Details
### You will learn
  - How to add an SAPUI5 app to SAP Work Zone's **Home** page.


To add business apps to SAP Work Zone, you need to configure them in a tool called the **Content Manager**, located in the Work Zone Manager. The **Content Manager** includes various editors that you can use to configure apps, groups, roles, and catalogs. Once configured, the app appears as a tile in the **Applications** page of your work zone - a single page that acts as an embedded launchpad. The page is accessed from the top-level menu of SAP Work Zone and displays the business apps that a user has permissions to launch.


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Open the Content Manager)]

1. Access the **Administration Console** from the user actions dropdown menu under your avatar.

    !![Open the admin console](1-open-admin-console.png)

    >Note that this option is only available to SAP Work Zone administrators.


2. Go to the **External Integrations** section, expand it, and click **Business Content**.

    !![Open business content](2-business-content.png)

3. Click **Content Manager** to open it with the **My Content** tab in focus.

    !![Open content manager](3-open-content-manager.png)

>The Content Manager has two tabs:<div>&nbsp;</div><div> **My Content** where you can manually configure content items (such as apps, roles, groups, and catalogs) and view any other available content items in your subaccount.<div>&nbsp;</div><div>The **Content Explorer** where you can explore exposed content from available content providers and add it to your subaccount (displayed in **My Content**).<div>&nbsp;</div><div>

<div>&nbsp;</div><div>

>When you open the **Content Manager**, you'll see a side panel on the left with links to the  following tools:<div>&nbsp;</div><div>
<div>&nbsp;</div><div> - The **Work Zone Directory** where the SAP Work Zone tile resides.<div>&nbsp;</div><div> - The **Content Manager** where you manage business apps that you can add to your work zone.
<div>&nbsp;</div><div> - The **Provider Manager** where you manage content providers. Content providers expose business content that you can integrate into your work zone.
<div>&nbsp;</div><div> - The **Work Zone Configurator** where you can set up your work zone when onboarding to the product if this isn't already done for you.
<div>&nbsp;</div><div> - The **Settings** where you can configure various settings related to your subaccount.<div>&nbsp;</div><div>

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create and configure a new app)]

First you need to create and configure the app.

      !![Define app properties](7-app-properties.png)

    >When working in your own environment, it's better to integrate SAPUI5 apps by configuring a destination to the relevant system and setting the app properties to use this destination. In this case in the App UI Technology dropdown list, you would select SAPUI5. This configuration allows you to better manage your content in the Dev-QA-Prod lifecycle.

3. Click the **NAVIGATION** tab to specify the intent of your app.

    >The unique combination of a semantic object and an action is called an intent. It is used to define navigation to an application.

4. Enter the following values:


    * **Semantic Object**: `Order`

    * **Action**: `Display`

      !![Define navigation properties](8-navigation-properties.png)

6. Enter the following values:

    * **Subtitle**: `Shopping Cart `

    * **Information**:  `Order Now!`

    * **Icon**: Click the browse icon, type `my-sales-order`, click on the displayed icon, and click **OK**.
