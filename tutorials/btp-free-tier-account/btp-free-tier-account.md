# Get an Account on SAP BTP to Try Out Free Tier Service Plans
<!-- description --> Sign up for a productive account on SAP Business Technology Platform and try out SAP's services with free tier service plans.

## Prerequisites
To activate your consumption-based SAP BTP global account with free tier service plans, you need:
  - an **e-mail address**
  - and a **credit card** for authentication and eventually later for billing purposes.
  **Important:** If you do not own a credit card, you can create a trial account which allows you to try out BTP services in a separate environment but without the free tier model on SAP BTP: [Get a Free Account on SAP BTP Trial](hcp-create-trial-account). Note that the trial landscape offers different service plans than the free tier model for BTP, see: [Get an SAP BTP Account for Tutorials](btp-cockpit-setup). To see which services are currently available in trial, go to [SAP Discovery Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap), select the service you are interested in and explore our offerings under **Pricing** and **Trial**.

## How does free tier work?
The global account you will create in this tutorial gives you access to a productive environment with both free and paid plans. If you activate **free tier** plans only, you can try out our platform for free, without time limits. You can then easily upgrade to a paid plan without losing your data or work. Creating an instance using a paid plan will incur costs, however. For more information, see [Enterprise Accounts](https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/171511cc425c4e079d0684936486eee6.html?locale=en-US&version=Cloud) and [Using Free Service Plans](https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/524e1081d8dc4b0f9d055a6bec383ec3.html?locale=en-US&version=Cloud).

### Create a subaccount

You are now in your global account, to be more precise in your **Account Explorer**. To access the free tier service plans, you first need to create a subaccount in your global account.

1. Select **Create** in the upper right corner.

2. Choose **Subaccount**.

    <!-- border -->![Create a Subaccount](btp-free-tier-account-subaccount.png)

3. A window opens. In the wizard, fill out the following information for your subaccount:

    - **Display Name**: Choose a meaningful and unique name to identify your subaccount.
    > Consider naming your subaccount *'Free'*. This way, you'll know exactly which services are free to use.

    - **Subdomain**: Added automatically. The subdomain will become part of the URL for accessing applications that you subscribe to from this subaccount. The subdomain can contain only letters, digits, and hyphens (not allowed at the beginning or at the end), and must be unique across all subaccounts in the same region.
    - **Region**: Select the region closest to you. You can use the service catalogue in [SAP Discovery Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/viewServices) to see which services with free tier service plans are available in each region.
    > **Caution:** Unfortunately, Cloud Foundry Runtime is currently not available for cf-eu10 (Europe Frankfurt, Amazon Web Services).

    - **Description** (optional): Add an additional description to identify your subaccount.

4. Select **Create**.
> The creation of your subaccount might take a couple of moments. Wait until the orange loading board "Onboarding" has disappeared.


### Assign entitlements for Cloud Foundry environment

In your global account, you now need to assign entitlements before you can enable Cloud Foundry

1. In your global account, navigate to **Entitlements** > **Entity Assignments.**
2. In the **Select Entities** selection, choose the directory or subaccount that you want to assign entitlements to.
3. Click **Go**. You'll see a table for the directory/ subaccount with all entitlements it already has.
4. Click **Configure Entitlements**, then select **Add Service Plans**. A popover appears with all entitlements available for your directory/ subaccount.
5. Select the service and then the plan you want to entitle. In the search, type in **Cloud Foundry Runtime**.
6. Select the plan called **Free** here to use the service without any costs.
7. Click **Add Service Plans** to exit the popover.
8. Click **Save**.


### Enable Cloud Foundry environment

You now need to activate Cloud Foundry environment.

1. Go back to your subaccount by clicking on **Subaccount** in the navigation bar.

2. Select **Cloud Foundry Environment**.

3. Click on **Enable Cloud Foundry**.

    <!-- border -->![Cloud Foundry Environment](btp-free-tier-account-enable-cf.png)

4. In the opening wizard, select **free** as plan - any other configuration will generate costs. Keep the rest of settings as they are and proceed by clicking **Create**.

    <!-- border -->![Cloud Foundry Free plan](btp-free-tier-cf-free-plan.png)

> Enabling Cloud Foundry environment might take a couple of moments. Thank you for patience.



### Create a space

As a last step, you now need to create a space to develop in.

1. In your subaccount, stay with **Overview** > **Cloud Foundry Environment**.

2. Select **Create Space**.

    <!-- border -->![Create a space](btp-free-tier-account-space.png)

3. In the opening wizard, enter a meaningful name for your space. The other fields are pre-populated.

4. Select **Create**.

You will receive a success message "Space created successfully."
