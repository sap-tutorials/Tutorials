    In the background, a new Kubernetes cluster is being set up where the Kyma runtime and all its components will run on. This might take between 15-25 min.

    To continue with this tutorial, you need to wait until the enablement is finished. You can still use the SAP BTP Free Tier or close the window as the setup process will continue automatically.

The Kyma Dashboard should open in a new Browser Tab.

The dashboard or Kyma console UI is your graphical playground for managing and deploying applications or services on the Kyma runtime. With the dashboard you can not only deploy or delete deployments but also manage them for scale, expose them over self-defined API Rules and much more.

To learn more about the capabilities and features of the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime, follow the Kyma tutorials, blog posts, read the documentation or check out the YouTube videos. If you aren't aware, there is also a [Kyma slack channel](https://kyma-community.slack.com/) where you can ask questions to the active community.
