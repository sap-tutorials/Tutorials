### Create a new Content Provider


In a first step, you will add the SAP S/4HANA system as a content provider.

1. Open the SAP Launchpad Site Manager.

2. Click the Provider Manager tab.

    ![Go to Provider Manager](1-open-provider-manager.png)

3. Click **+New** to create a new Content Provider.

    ![New Content Provider](2-new-provider-manager.png)

4. Fill in the form using the destinations that you created in the second tutorial.

    |  Field Name     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Name           | `SAP S/4HANA`
    |  Description    | `SAP S/4HANA demo system`
    |  ID             | Remove /, so the ID does not contain special characters except underscores.
    |  Design-Time Destination  | Select `s4hanadt` from drop-down list
    |  Runtime Destination  | Select `s4hanart` from drop-down list
    |  Runtime Destination for OData  | `Use default runtime destination`
    |  Content Addition Mode  | `Manual addition of selected content items`

   5. Click **Save**.

       ![Provider creation form](3b-new-content-provider.png)

    > If you select *Automatic addition of all content items*, all exposed content items will be automatically selected in the Content Explorer and added to the My Content tab, as soon as you create the content provider. In this case, when updating a provider, all the new content items are automatically added. In this exercise, you will add content items manually.

    > If you select *Include group and catalog assignments to roles*, the relationship of groups and catalogs to roles from the SAP S/4HANA system is taken into account for the display of the groups and catalogs on the Launchpad service. For more details see [the documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/Launchpad_Service/8c8e1958338140699bd4811b37b82ece/215517e6d4f44c96b790bbcb56d63572.html).

    The content provider is added to the list and the content is loaded. This might take some seconds.

  6. Wait till the status says **Created**. If this takes long, try refreshing the browser page.

7. Click the **Back to Site Directory** icon.

    ![Back to Site Directory](18-back-to-site-directory.png)


### Assign roles to your user


Apps are only displayed to users with the corresponding roles assigned. You assign those roles as role collections to users in the SAP BTP cockpit.

1. Open the SAP BTP cockpit of your trial account.

2. Navigate to **Security > Users** to assign the role collections to your user. When you added the federated content, one role collection for each federated role was automatically created.

    ![Select your user](20a-select-user.png)

4. In the user details panel on the right, click the three dots in the **Role Collections** section to open the menu. Then select ``Assign Role Collection``.
