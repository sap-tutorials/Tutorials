### Adding Our Union Calculation View into the Converted Data Model


We have converted the original information into all calculation views so that they can support other calculation views. We then created a new calculation view which was a union between hot and warm data. Now we will replace `ORDERS_CS` with the new calculation view inside of `AV_ORDERS`.

Under the `tutorial_All_Calc` package, open up `AV_ORDERS` in the graphical viewer. Under **Projection**, right click `ORDERS_CS` and click **Remove**.

> Note: You may need to expand **Projection** by clicking the `+` button beside its name.

You will receive a warning that column references will get removed because of this action. Click **Yes** and **OK** to confirm.

Similar to the previous tutorial, we will drag `CA_UNION` view over from the **Systems** panel, and drop it into the **Projection** node.

Afterwards, select the **Projection** node to edit its details in the **Details** panel. Click the gray dots for `O_CUSTERKEY`, `O_ORDERSTATUS`, `O_TOTALPRICE`, and `O_ORDERDATE`. This will add them to the output and the color of the dots will change to orange to indicate that they are now included in the output.

Now, select the **Star Join** node to edit it. Toggle all the gray circles to become orange, except for the `O_CUSTKEY` from **Projection**. Then, connect `O_CUSTKEY` with `C_CUSTKEY`. This is done by clicking anywhere on one row, and dragging your cursor to another row.

You may see a warning sign above the **Projection** node. If it reads "No columns added to the output" when you have already done so (denoted by the orange dots), you may ignore this warning.

Next, we will select the **Semantics**, to ensure each column is set as the right type. Toggle the type so that `O_ORDERDATE` and `ORDERSTATUS` are attributes (denoted by a blue diamond), and `O_TOTALPRICE` is a measure (denoted by an orange bar) with a "Sum" aggregation.

### Activate View

Navigate to `tutorial_All_Calc` in **Systems**. Under `tutorial_All_Calc` > Calculation Views, right click `AV_ORDERS` and click **Activate**.

We have successfully added extended tables to an existing information model! In summary, we took the old `AV_ORDERS` used the in-memory table called `ORDERS_CS`, and combined it with `AT_REGION` to create a result set showing each customer key with its corresponding region name, order status, order data, and total price from the last year. This new `AV_ORDERS` view combines the new `CA_UNION` view (which is a union of `ORDERS_CS` and `ORDERS_DT`) with `AT_REGION`, creating a result with the same fields as before, but now includes data from all years, including the data that has been aged out to the extended table in Dynamic Tiering.
