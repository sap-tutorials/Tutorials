### Enable your deployed UI5 integration card


1. Access the **Administration Console** from the user actions dropdown menu under your avatar.

The card is now enabled and can be added to the workpage in your workspace.

>In this step, for workshops, use your unique identifier `<your unique identifier>_Products by Vendor Card`.

>You can click on **Configure** to select a different destination for this UI5 integration card. As you used the same ES5 destination in this SAP BTP subaccount and also when you developed the card, this step is not required to complete this tutorial.


### Configure the card settings


Before you add the card to your workspace, let's configure one of the settings of the card.

1. On the `Products by Vendor Card`, click **Configure**.

    <!-- border -->![Click Configure](3a-click-configure.png)

2. Under **General Settings**, change the **Maximum Items** to 2 and select the destination. If you're in a workshop, you can select the destination that you created:  `<your unique ID_ES5`>. Then click **Save changes**.

    | Text            | Type in the following: `Products of vendors sponsoring the hackathon, see what you can win!`.
    | Font            | Select the text and change to Arial 14pt.
    | Color           | With the text already selected, choose black from the chart.

4. Click outside of the widget section to see how your workpage looks so far.

5. Select the text widget you just added, and drag it above the card widget that you added before.

6. Click **Publish** to publish your workpage.

    <!-- border -->![Publish workspace](12-publish.png)

Your workspace should look like this - note that the card is only showing 2 out of 20 products because you configured it that way.
