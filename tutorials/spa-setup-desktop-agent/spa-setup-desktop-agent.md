### About the Desktop Agent


The Desktop Agent is an on-premise component of SAP Process Automation that is installed locally on user desktops. It executes automation projects that launch and run applications of various kinds, read information from screens, enter data, click options, and process data.

Projects are assigned to tenants running on a Desktop Agent. You can see what your Desktop Agent is doing at all times thanks to the convenient system tray, or `Systray`, that is always accessible while your Desktop Agent is ready or active.

When it is installed, the Desktop Agent is configured to start at Windows logon automatically. You should not change this setting because your Agent might be assigned background (unattended) jobs at any time.

The very first time you launch the Desktop Agent on your workstations, you will be prompted to log in. If you are unsure of your login details, please ask an administrator.


### Install the Desktop Agent


When you install the Desktop Agent, this will automatically set up the SAP Intelligent RPA web browser extension for Google Chrome and Edge.

>To prevent issues during the installation, please close all the Chrome tabs opened on your machine. The setup program is provided in the form of an industry standard Windows MSI installer. You can download it from the SAP Software Center.

>The minimum version of the Desktop Agent supported by SAP Process automation is **2.0.20**.

1. Download the **latest version**  of the [MSI file execution](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud).

    > MSI version will be updated for every new release. Always download the latest version.

    >Microsoft Edge and Chromium are used for the rendering of the Desktop Agent. If you use Edge, the Edge 'WebView2' component is mandatory: if not already installed on your machine, please install Edge WebView2 from the Microsoft website.

    A Google Chrome extension and an Internet Explorer add-on are installed when you install the Desktop Agent but you have to enable them (at least the Google Chrome extension).

8. Launch your Google Chrome then select the "Enable extension" button.
