The API can contain one or more endpoints which are organized into groups. On the left-hand side of selected API - **Campaign**, you can see six groups of endpoints.

Various HTTP methods of API are used to address the functionality of endpoints. While exploring the endpoints, you may wish to collapse the information by selecting the `GET` operation row. You can explore the available endpoints for the API to understand it in detail.

### Test an API endpoint

The SAP API Business Hub allows you to test APIs. A sandbox environment is provided to test the Campaign API. To take advantage of this, ensure you are logged on. Select Login at the top of the page.

<!-- border -->![Login](6.png)

Once logged on, choose the Try Out button in the **`Overview`** section.

<!-- border -->![The "Try out" button](6a.png)

Selecting this will open the Try Out View.

For the purpose of this tutorial the **`GET /CampaignCollection`** operation has been selected for testing.

<!-- border -->![Get method for Campaign API](6b.png)

Calling the `GET` operation on the `/CampaignCollection` endpoint will return a list of entities from Campaign Collection. The `$top` parameter can be used to retrieve only the first _n_ results once all the other filtering is done. Specify a value of **20** for this parameter.

Once the required inputs are entered, Choose `Run` at the top right corner to view the response.
