## Prerequisites
- **Tutorial**: [Set Up Initial Configuration for an MDK App](cp-mobile-dev-kit-ms-setup)
- **Download the latest version of Mobile Development Kit SDK** either from the SAP community [download page](https://developers.sap.com/trials-downloads.html?search=Mobile%20development%20kit) or [SAP Software Center](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/softwarecenter/search/Mobile%2520development%2520kit) if you are a SAP Mobile Services customer

## Details
### You will learn
  - How to install a Mobile development kit client SDK on Mac and Windows OS
  - How to build a Mobile development kit client for iOS and Android
  - How to connect to SAP Mobile app

  The SAP Mobile Services client available in the App Store is meant for demo and development or learning purposes. For distribution to your users, you need to build a custom client. This enables you to:

-	Provide customer app icon
-	Use your signing profiles
-	Distribute custom extensions
-	Provide app-specific settings (Custom EULA texts, Add app assets)
-	Add demo mode
-	Customize languages (for onboarding screens)
-	Use your own distribution channels, like the mobile device management of your choice

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Installing the SDK dependencies)]

>Make sure you are choosing the right development platform tab above.

[OPTION BEGIN [Mac]]

1. To use the SDK to generate a mobile development kit client, the first step is to set up the SDK to create a client. Unzip `MDKClient_SDK.zip` if it is not already extracted.

    !![MDK](img_2.1.png)

2. From a terminal window, navigate to the `[path] -> MDKClient_SDK` folder and execute `./install.command`. If everything is fine, you will a success message in the console followed by next steps.

    !![MDK](img_2.2.1.png)

    !![MDK](img_2.2.2.png)

    Notice that the `create-client.command` file has appeared in the SDK directory.

2. From a command line window, navigate to the `[path] -> MDKClient_SDK` folder and execute `install.cmd`.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Create your .mdkproject folder)]

>Make sure you are choosing the right development platform tab above.

[OPTION BEGIN [Mac]]

1. In the `MDKClient_SDK` folder, you will find the `template.mdkproject` folder.

    !![MDK](img-3.1.png)

    It is recommended that you copy this folder to another location so that you can to use it for future builds. Copy and paste it anywhere, and then rename template to `DemoSampleApp.mdkproject`.

    !![MDK](img-3.2.png)

2. Next, you will need to update the `BrandedSettings.json` and `MDKProject.json` files as needed for your client. Go into the `DemoSampleApp.mdkproject` folder.

    !![MDK](img-3.2.0.png)

3. Open the `MDKProject.json` file and update it as needed. This file has some build-time configurations such as the application name, version and bundle ID.

    !![MDK](img-3.3.png)

    >`AppName`: Provide a name for example: `DemoSampleApp`. It is the name of the application on the home screen of the device and it is also the name of the folder where the client is created.

    >`BundleID`: It should be a unique identifier for your application.  This controls if the client can be installed side by side with other applications on the device.  Two applications with the same Bundle ID cannot be installed at the same time on a device.  For iOS this is the Identifier `(AppID)` that is registered in Apple Developer account since that determines if the application can be installed alongside other applications. If the `XCode` project is set up to use _Automatically manage signing_ then when building, `XCode` will automatically generate a signing profile for the specified bundle id. Without matching them, trying to run the custom client in iOS device will result in failure. In Android, it is known as [application ID](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id).

    >`URLScheme`: Allows you to specify a custom URL scheme which opens the client. This value is provided in step 2 for **Redirect URL**.
     If the URL includes connection settings as URL parameters, these settings will override the ones used by the client. The default is `mdkclient`. This value needs to match the value provided in step 2 for the Redirect URL. This value also needs to be unique across applications on your device.  If the value is not unique the wrong application may be referenced when redirecting.

    >You can find more details about configuration of `MDKProject.json` file in [this](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/getting-started/mdk/custom-client/branding-custom-client.html) help documentation.        

4. Now, open the `BrandedSettings.json` file and update the `ConnectionSettings` with the values for your MDK application in Mobile Services.

    !![MDK](img-3.4.png)

    To find the correct URLs for your client, you should navigate to  [Mobile Services cockpit](cp-mobile-dev-kit-ms-setup) and find your MDK application that you want to link to this client.

    4.1 Click `com.sap.mdk.demo` > **Security** tab.

    Copy the Client ID, Redirect URL, OAuth Authorisation & OAuth Token and paste to `ClientId`, `RedirectUrl`, `AuthorizationEndPointUrl` and `TokenUrl` parameters respectively.

    !![MDK](img_3.4.1.png)

    4.2 `AppId`: App ID from `Info` tab.

    !![MDK](img_3.4.2.png)

    4.3 `ServerUrl`: Server URL from `APIs` tab.

    !![MDK](img_3.4.3.png)

    >For Android (7 and below), screen sharing or taking screen shots are disabled by default. To enable it, `add "EnableScreenSharing": true` in `ConnectionSettings` section. Screen sharing is already enabled in Android 8 and above. You can find more information about `Enable Screen Sharing` in [this](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/getting-started/mdk/custom-client/branding-custom-client.html#enable-screen-sharing) help documentation.

    Regarding other properties:
    **Debug settings**: The settings in the `DebugSettings` property are for development use and should not be enabled in a production setting.

    **Log Settings**: Set this to the log level to be used when the client is launched.

    **Demo**: If you want to access the app in the demo mode, you can configure required settings.        

    >If you are connecting to `AliCloud` accounts, you will also need to add your custom domains under `URLWhitelist` property in the same file. You can find more details in [documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/getting-started/mdk/custom-client/branding-custom-client.html#connection-settings-allowlist).

5. In the last section of `BrandedSettings.json` file, make these changes:

    | Field | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `DetailLabelViewText` | `My first custom MDK client` |
    | `SigninButtonText` | `Start` |

3. In terminal or command line window, navigate to the app name folder **`DemoSampleApp`** (in `MDClient_SDK` path) and use `tns run android --device <device identifier>` command to run the MDK client on android device.

    !![MDK](img_5.3.png)

    >To run the MDK client on Android emulator, you need to use `tns run android --emulator` command. Before trying to launch the client on Android emulator, make sure that you have already configured a virtual device (Android Studio>AVD Manager). Otherwise, you may get an error like No emulator image available for device identifier.

    Once, above command gets successfully executed, you will see new MDK client up and running in Android device.

4. In Welcome screen, you will notice that **app name**, **detailed label text** and **signing button text** have been updated as per changes done in step 3.4 & 3.5. Tap **START** to connect MDK client to SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP).
