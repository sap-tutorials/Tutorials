[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Database explorer overview)]

The SAP HANA database explorer is a web-based tool for browsing and working with SAP HANA database objects such as tables, views, functions, stored procedures, importing and exporting data, debugging SQLScript, executing SQL statements, creating remote sources, working with multi-model data such as graph, spatial and JSON collections, viewing trace files, and troubleshooting.  

It was previously named SAP HANA Runtime Tools (HRTT) and was introduced in SAP HANA 1.0 SPS 12. As it is web-based, individual users do not need to worry about installing the software or applying patches.  The SAP HANA Cloud version offers support for data lake Relational Engine connections, and as of March 14 2022, support for the data lake Files container.

> The following tools also provide the ability to execute SQL queries.

  * `hdbsql` is a text based tool that can be used to query an SAP HANA database.  For additional details see [Use Clients to Query an SAP HANA Database](mission.hana-cloud-clients). 
  
  * `dbisql` is a text based tool that can be used to query a data lake. For additional details see [Use Clients to Query Data Lake Relational Engine](group.hana-cloud-clients-data-lake).

  * [SAP HANA Database Explorer for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPSE.hana-database-explorer&ssr=false#overview) is an extension for Visual Studio Code that offers a subset of the functionality in the SAP HANA database explorer.

The SAP HANA database explorer can be opened from multiple locations as shown below:

* From the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) Cockpit from an SAP HANA or Data Lake instance.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Version information)]
The SAP HANA database explorer releases independently of SAP HANA.  New features appear first in SAP HANA Cloud and are available to the on-premise version if applicable, in a later release.  Features are also enabled based on the database being connected to.  For example, the ability to import and export from cloud storage providers is a feature of an SAP HANA Cloud database.

The screenshots below show the version of the SAP HANA database explorer in SAP HANA Cloud and on-premise.  

The image below shows the SAP HANA database explorer running in SAP HANA Cloud.  

![latest available version in SAP HANA Cloud](dbx-hana-cloud-version.png)

The image below shows the SAP HANA database explorer running in an on-premise installation.  

![latest available version for on-premise](dbx-on-premise-version.png)

For the on-premise edition, only the currently released version receives patches.  For example, now that version 2.14.X has been released, there will no longer be fixes made to  the 2.13.X release.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](SAP HANA Cloud trial or free tier)]

>To complete the tutorials in this group, an SAP HANA instance is needed. Steps 3 and 5 in this tutorial provide two different, free options that can be used to set up an SAP HANA instance.  Only one of these steps needs to be completed if you currently do not have access to an SAP HANA instance. When creating an SAP HANA instance, a Data Lake is not needed.  Creating a Data Lake will be covered in a later tutorial.

Continue on to the next tutorial in this group once you have created an SAP HANA Cloud instance as shown below.

!![SAP HANA Cloud Trial instance](hana-cloud-instance.png)

>Note that the SAP HANA Cloud trial or free tier instances are shut down overnight and will need to be restarted before working with them the next day. Details on how to start or manage your trial or free tier instance can be viewed at [Provision an Instance of SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database](hana-cloud-mission-trial-2) or via the Cloud Foundry CLI in the next step.

The instructions on how to setup a free SAP HANA Cloud trial or free tier within SAP BTP are well covered in a number of other sources listed below.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Manage SAP HANA Cloud using a CLI (optional))]

The Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) provides users another option for managing their SAP HANA Cloud instances. The software can be downloaded from the [Cloud Foundry Foundation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) and is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. The following steps will demonstrate how to start and manage an SAP HANA Cloud instance using the CLI.

1. Complete the installation process by following the guide [Installing the cf CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).

2. Copy the API endpoint from your SAP HANA Cloud account. This information can be found on the Overview page of your SAP BTP Cockpit. The API endpoint is listed under the Cloud Foundry subheading. Save the API endpoint for use in the next step.

    !![Find the API Endpoint from the BTP Cockpit](apiEndpoint.PNG)

3. In your terminal, type the following command. Replace the API endpoint with the one you copied from the previous step:

    ```Shell
    cf api https://api.cf.XXXX.hana.ondemand.com
    ```
    You will be asked to login with the email and password on your SAP HANA Cloud account. Finally you will be prompted to select your targeted space within your account. Additional details on logging in can be found at [Getting Started with the CF CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/getting-started.html#user-cups).

    !![Cloud CLI API](cf-api.png)

4. Next, view the list of services.

    ```Shell
    cf services
    ```

    !![cloud foundry services](cf-services.png)

5. The `hana` service can be started with a file named `start.json` with the below contents and the following command.

    ```JSON
    {
    	"data":
    	{
    		"serviceStopped":false
    	}
    }
    ```

    ```Shell
    cf update-service HC_HDB_Trial -c start.json
    ```
    !![starting a SAP HANA Cloud database](cf-start.png)

For more information on the operations available with the CLI, refer to the documentation [Using the Cloud Foundry CLI with SAP HANA Cloud](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9ae9104a46f74a6583ce5182e7fb20cb/hanacloud/en-US/921f3e46247947779d69b8c85c9b9985.html).  

>Note that SAP HANA Cloud Central provides an option in the actions menu to copy the JSON configuration of a running instance.  This can be used with the `cf create-service` command perhaps to create multiple instances of a database configured in the same way.

>![copy Configuration](hcc-copy-json.png)

>---

>Another tool that can be used to manage a SAP HANA Cloud instance is the SAP Automation Pilot.  It provides commands for working with an SAP HANA Cloud instances as well as Cloud Foundry applications.  The below is an example command used to stop an SAP HANA Cloud instance.  

>![stop SAP HANA Cloud command](automation-pilot.png)

>The Automation Pilot also provides a scheduler and integration with SAP Alert Notification Service.  For further details see [Take Action Following a SAP HANA Cloud Database Alert with SAP Automation Pilot](hana-cloud-alerts-autopilot).

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](SAP HANA, express edition)]

>This step only needs to be completed if you currently do not have access to an SAP HANA instance and did not setup an SAP HANA instance through the SAP HANA Cloud as explained in step 3.

An alternative option to using the SAP HANA Cloud trial or free tier is to use the SAP HANA, express edition.  SAP provides a free, streamlined version of SAP HANA that runs on developer laptops called [SAP HANA, express edition](https://www.sap.com/cmp/td/sap-hana-express-edition.html).

SAP HANA runs on certain versions of Linux.  SAP HANA, express edition provides a binary install as well as virtual machine images that can be run on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux machines.  This is described in the [SAP HANA, express edition](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_HANA,_EXPRESS_EDITION/latest/en-US?task=implement_task) documentation under the implement section.  A database-only option and a database + XS Advanced Applications option are available. The database + XS Advanced Applications install includes the SAP HANA cockpit, the SAP HANA database explorer, and the SAP HANA Web IDE for SAP HANA.

>Database + XS Advanced Applications, requires sufficient disk space and memory (32 GB).

Once installed, a useful starting point is the page below.  

![XSA is up and running](xsa-is-up.png)

It contains links to the SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA, SAP HANA cockpit, and the SAP HANA cockpit manager.
