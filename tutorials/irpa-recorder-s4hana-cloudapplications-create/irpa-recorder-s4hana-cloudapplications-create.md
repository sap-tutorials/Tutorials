### Record your application

This step involves recording the setting of the values for  **Supplier**, **Purchasing Organization** and **Purchasing Group**.

|  Field Name     | Value
|  :------------- | :-------------
|  Supplier           | **`USSU-TRL04`**
|  Purchasing Organization           | **`1710`**
|  Purchasing Group    | **`Z10`**


>When you click the **Record** button the **Cloud Studio** is locked and you will be directed to the application you want to record. **Recording in progress** pop-up message is displayed.

<!-- border -->![Recorder2](irpa-recorder2.png)

1.  To start the recording, click the recorder ![Recorder button](recorder.png) button. The recorder will capture the screen. You can see it in the **Activities** list.

2.  Click the **Create** button on the page.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder3](irpa-recorder3.png)

3.  The activity is added.

4.  The recorder will detect a change of screen. Click the capture ![Capture button](capture.png) button to record it.

    > ### What is going on?
    >The Recorder captures the first screen of an application automatically and  the following screens must be captured manually by clicking the capture ![Capture button](capture.png) button. Then the actions you perform on that screen will be recorded automatically.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder4](irpa-recorder4.png)

    >**CAUTION:** While recording, if a new screen appears or if there is a change in the UI, you must first click the button manually. You can then perform the actions in the application screens. This is applicable across the workflow recording.

    The recorder will add the new screen with the new purchase order that needs to be created. Now you need to set the values for **Supplier**, **Purchasing Organization** and **Purchasing Group**.

5.  In the **Supplier** input field, click the **Show Value Help** icon.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder5](irpa-recorder5.png)

6.  A change of screen is detected, click the capture ![Capture button](capture.png) button.
    > ### What is going on?
    >Whenever a new screen appears or if there is a change in the UI, the Recorder detects the screen change in most of the cases and displays a hint message. This gives you a hint to capture a screen manually by clicking the Capture button .
    The hint message disappears when you click the capture button or perform any action on the screen.
