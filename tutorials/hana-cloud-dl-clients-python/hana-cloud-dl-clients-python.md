# Connect to Data Lake Relational Engine Using Python Drivers
<!-- description --> Create and debug a Python application that connects to data lake Relational Engine using the sqlanydb python driver or the pyodbc bridge.

## Prerequisites
 - You have completed the first 2 tutorials in this group


## You will learn
  - How to install Python and the `sqlanydb` and `pyodbc` Python drivers
  - How to create and debug a Python application that connects to and queries a data lake Relational Engine database using the `sqlanydb` python driver or the `pyodbc` bridge

---

## Intro
The following steps create a simple Python app that can connect to and query an SAP HANA data lake Relational Engine.

### Install Python


The first step is to check if Python and pip are installed.

1. Enter the commands below.

    ```Shell
    python --version
    python3 --version
    ```
    If Python is installed, the command will return a value such as Python 3.10.3.

    If Python is not installed, it can be downloaded from [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

    On Microsoft Windows, check the box that says **Add Python 3.x to PATH** as shown below to ensure that the interpreter will be placed in your path.

2. Enter the commands below.

    ```Shell
    pip --version
    pip3 --version
    pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

    The standard package installer for Python is [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).  The following commands will check the version of pip and attempt to upgrade it to the latest available version.  Again, use the pip or pip3 command that returns a version 3.4 or greater of Python.

    >On Linux or Mac, if you encounter permission issues, one way to solve the issue is to use `sudo` before the command.

    >---

    >On Linux, if Python is installed but pip is not, it can be installed on openSUSE using Zypper as shown below.

    >```Shell (Linux)
    zypper install python3-pip
    >```


### Install the sqlanydb Python driver


The `sqlanydb` package is the python driver for the data lake Relational Engine and is available at [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/project/sqlanydb/).

1. Navigate to your Data Lake Client installation folder, and enter the following command to install `sqlanydb`.

    ```Shell (Microsoft Windows)
    cd %IQDIR17%\SDK\Python
    python setup.py install
    ```

    ```Shell (Linux)
    cd $IQDIR17/sdk/python
    python setup.py install
    ```

    This should create additional build directories in the current folder.

2. On Microsoft Windows, create a user environment variable named `SQLANY_API_DLL` and set it to `%IQDIR17%\Bin64\dbcapi.dll`.

    ![add a variable named SQLANY_API_DLL](add-variable.png)


### Create a Python application that uses sqlanydb to query the data lake Relational Engine


1. In a shell, create a folder named `python-sqlanydb`, enter the newly created directory, and open a file name `pythonQuery.py` in an editor.

    ```Shell (Microsoft Windows)
    mkdir %HOMEPATH%\DataLakeClientsTutorial\python-sqlanydb
    cd %HOMEPATH%\DataLakeClientsTutorial\python-sqlanydb
    notepad pythonQuery.py
    ```

    Substitute `pico` below for your preferred text editor.

    ```Shell (Linux)
    mkdir -p $HOME/DataLakeClientsTutorial/python-sqlanydb
    cd $HOME/DataLakeClientsTutorial/python-sqlanydb
    pico pythonQuery.py
    ```

2. Copy the following code into `pythonQuery.py`:

    ```Python
    #Import your dependencies
    import sqlanydb

    #Initialize your connection
    conn = sqlanydb.connect(uid='USER1', pwd='Password1', host='XX.iq.hdl.trial-us10.hanacloud.ondemand.com:443',enc='TLS{tls_type=rsa;direct=yes}')

    #If no errors, print connected
    print('connected')

    curs = conn.cursor()
    sql_command = "select TITLE, FIRSTNAME, NAME from HOTEL.CUSTOMER;"
    curs.execute(sql_command)
    rows = curs.fetchall()
    for row in rows:
        for col in row:
            print ("%s" % col, end=" ")
        print ("  ")

    curs.close()
    conn.close()
    ```

3. Replace the host value.

4. Run the app. Make sure your data lake Relational Engine is running before executing the app.

    ```Shell
    python pythonQuery.py
    ```

    ![python Query](sqlanydb-success.png)

For further information on the Python Driver, visit [Python and Database Access](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a894a54d84f21015b142ffe773888f8c/latest/en-US/3bdc877e6c5f1014b7b2d2a9739b2bc8.html).


### Install the Python ODBC bridge using pip and PyPI


This is an alternate method of connecting to a data lake Relation Engine from a Python app. The Python ODBC bridge is an open source Python module available on [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/project/pyodbc/).  The performance characteristics between the two drivers may vary depending on the use case.

1. Ensure that you have created a connection to the data lake Relational Engine using ODBC as shown in step 1 or 2 of the [Connect to Data Lake Relational Engine Using the ODBC Driver](hana-cloud-dl-clients-odbc) tutorial.

2. The repository that contains Python packages is [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/) and includes a package for the `pyodbc` driver.

    ![pyodbc on PyPI](Pyodbc.png)  

3. Install `pyodbc`

    ```Shell
    pip install pyodbc
    ```


    >If this command fails on Microsoft Windows with an error "Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required", additional details can be found at [Unable to install pyodbc using python 3.10 in windows 10](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69943254/unable-to-install-pyodbc-using-python-3-10-in-windows-10) and [Release python 3.10 win wheels for pyodbc](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues/981).

    >---

    >If this command fails on Linux, you may need to install gcc-c++, python3-devel, and unixodbc-dev.


### Create a Python application that uses pyodbc to query the data lake Relational Engine


1. In a shell, create a folder named `python-pyodbc`, enter the newly created directory, and open a file name `pythonQuery.py` in an editor.

    ```Shell (Microsoft Windows)
    mkdir %HOMEPATH%\DataLakeClientsTutorial\python-pyodbc
    cd %HOMEPATH%\DataLakeClientsTutorial\python-pyodbc
    notepad pythonQuery.py
    ```

    Substitute `pico` below for your preferred text editor.

    ```Shell (Linux)
    mkdir -p $HOME/DataLakeClientsTutorial/python-pyodbc
    cd $HOME/DataLakeClientsTutorial/python-pyodbc
    pico pythonQuery.py
    ```

2. Copy the following code into `pythonQuery.py`:

    ```Python
    #Import your dependencies
    import pyodbc

    #Initialize your connection
    conn = pyodbc.connect(uid='USER1',pwd='Password1',dsn='HC_DL_Trial')

    #If no errors, print connected
    print('connected')

    curs = conn.cursor()
    sql_command = "select TITLE, FIRSTNAME, NAME from HOTEL.CUSTOMER;"
    curs.execute(sql_command)
    rows = curs.fetchall()
    for row in rows:
        for col in row:
            print ("%s" % col, end=" ")
        print ("  ")

    curs.close()
    conn.close()
    ```

3. The `dsn` value refers to the data source name in the Microsoft Windows ODBC Administrator or the Linux `.odbc.ini` file.

    ![ODBC Administrator](odbcWindow.png)

    or

    ![unix](odbc-linux.png)

4. Run the app.

    ```Shell
    python pythonQuery.py
    ```

    >On some Linux distributions, python refers to a 2.x version of Python.  If so, replace `python` with `python3`.

    ![python Query](pyodbc-success.png)

The code in `pythonQuery.py` uses [PEP 249 -- Python Database API Specification](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/), which defines a set of methods that provide a consistent database interface, independent of the actual database being used.   


### Debug the application


Visual Studio Code provides plugins for Python and can be used to debug an application.  

1. If you have not already done so, download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

2. If you have not already done so, in Visual Studio Code, choose **File | Add Folder to Workspace**, and then add the `DataLakeClientsTutorial` folder.

    ![Workspace](workspace.png)

3. Open the file `pythonQuery.py`.

    ![Python File](OpenFile.png)

    Visual Studio Code will recognize the `py` file extension and will suggest installing the Python extension. Click **Install**.

4. Place a breakpoint on line the line `for row in rows:`.

5. Select **Run | Start Debugging | Python File Debug the currently active Python file**.

    Notice that the program stops running at the breakpoint that was set.

    Observe the variable values in the leftmost pane.  Step through code.

Congratulations! You have now created and debugged a Python application that connects to and queries a data lake Relational Engine database.
