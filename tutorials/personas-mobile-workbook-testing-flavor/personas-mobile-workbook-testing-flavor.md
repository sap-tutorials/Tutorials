You should then seen the simplified screen for your mobile device. If you have built different flavors to account for device orientation, you can test them by rotating your device. The flavor will automatically switch to account for the different screen size.

### Optional: Test your barcode scanner

If desired, you can also test the barcode scanner within you flavor. You will need to generate a QR code that represents a valid equipment number in your system. If you are using the training system provided by the SAP Screen Personas team, you can use the following **`210100019`**, **`210100024`**, or **`210100013`**.

You can use <https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com> to generate a QR code. Select **Free Text** and enter your equipment number.

Tap **Scan Equipment** on your flavor and then scan your QR code.
