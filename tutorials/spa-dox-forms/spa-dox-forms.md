# Create Forms for Invoice Approval Process
<!-- description --> Create the needed approval and notifications forms for the Invoice Approval Process

## Prerequisites
 - Created the [trigger](spa-dox-create-process), the [automation](spa-dox-create-automation) and also the [decision](spa-dox-create-decision) to come to this point in the process

## You will learn
   - How to leverage the result of the Decision in an approval form
   - How to create an approval form
   - How to create forms to notify process participants

## Intro
There are different requirements and business situations when a form is needed in a business process. You have already created a form to start the process. Most often you probably need a form to maintain some input data or to approve or reject a request or even to send out some notifications. The two latter ones are your focus now.

### Create New Approval Form


1. Choose **+** at the connection flow after the decision **Determine Approver** to open the context menu. Then select **Approvals > New Approval Form**.

2. Maintain the **Name** **`Invoice Approval Form`** and also the **Description** **`Form to approve the invoice`**. Choose **Create**. The **Identifier** is created automatically.

    <!-- border -->![Maintain approval form name](02.png)

3. Choose the three dots on the created form's artifact and select **Open Editor** to do the same. Just ignore the red frames, you will fill them later.

    <!-- border -->![Open Editor](03.png)

4. Now you are in the Form's Editor, where you can define the layout and input fields. First add via drag and drop a new **Headline 1** to the canvas.   Provide this headline **`Invoice Approval`**.

    <!-- border -->![Add Headline](04.png)

5. Drag and drop a **Paragraph** into the canvas. Insert **`Invoice Details`** in the paragraph.

    <!-- border -->![Add paragraph](05.png)

6. Include a **Text** field in your form.

    <!-- border -->![Add text field](06.png)

7. Change the name to **`Company Name`** and select **Read Only**, as you will display here some information from the process content.

    <!-- border -->![Maintain text field](07.png)

8. Add some further input fields to your form. Please ensure you have selected the correct type and also maintain all of them as **Read Only**.

    |  Field Type    | Name
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Text          | **`Invoice Number`**
    |  Number           | **`Gross Amount`**
    |  Text   | **`Employee Name`**

    <!-- border -->![Further input fields](08.png)

9. You are done with the layout and input fields of the approval form. **Save** your work.

10. Go back to your process, you will recognize some errors, e.g. inputs are missing. No need to worry, you will provide the required details in the next steps.

    <!-- border -->![Errors](09.png)

11. Select the **Invoice Approval Form** and in the **General** tab of the form properties, move to **Subject** and choose **Select Item**.

    <!-- border -->![Select Item](10.png)

12. Enter the text **`Please approve the invoice`** and add the process content **Document Number**. You will find this underneath **Invoice Details**. This combines plain text with process-related information and serves as an unique identifier for the end user.

    <!-- border -->![Add process content](11.png)

13. In the Decision you have defined the approver of the invoice. The output of the decision has been an email address. Now add from the process content within **determine Approver Output** the **eMail** in the **Recipients** as **Users**. This means only the selected approver will get this approval in the inbox.

    <!-- border -->![Approval user](12.png)

14. Switch to the **Inputs** tab and within **Employee Name** choose **Select Item**. The process content will be opened again.

    <!-- border -->![Approval Form inputs](14.png)

15. Now add the attributes from the process content to the related input fields.

    > You can only assign fields with the same type, e.g. text in the process content to text input field.
     If you cannot assign, e.g. Invoice Number from the process content to the Invoice Number in the input field, the type of the input field might be wrong. If so, please correct your form.

    |  Process Content    | Input Field
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Employee Name          | Employee Name
    |  Sender Name           | Company Name
    |  Gross Amount    | Gross Amount
    |  Document Number          | Invoice Number

    <!-- border -->![Add Approval Form inputs](15.png)

16. As this mapping of process content and forms is quite important to ensure a proper flow of the relevant data in your process, please check them again. It should look like this.
