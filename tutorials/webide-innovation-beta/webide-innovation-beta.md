[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Set up Cloud Foundry environment - OPTIONAL)]
If your scenario includes deploying apps to the Cloud Foundry environment, then you need to also set up this environment. These will generally be for full-stack applications that include database and Java modules.

Create a Cloud Foundry subaccount, organization, and space. See [Get a Trial Space on the Cloud Foundry Instance](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/76e79d62fa0149d5aa7b0698c9a33687.html).
