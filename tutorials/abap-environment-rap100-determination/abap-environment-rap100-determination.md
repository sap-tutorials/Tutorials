# Enhance the Business Object Behavior With Determinations
<!-- description --> Enhance the business object behavior using determination with SAP BTP ABAP environment.

## Prerequisites
- You need an SAP BTP, ABAP environment [trial user](abap-environment-trial-onboarding) or a license.
- You have downloaded and installed the [latest ABAP Development Tools (ADT)] (https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#abap).

## You will learn  
  - How to define determinations
  - How to implement determinations
  - How to preview and test enhanced travel app
 
  In the previous exercise, you've defined and implemented the early numbering for assigning automatically an identifier (ID) for a new instance of the BO entity Travel.

  In the present exercise, you will define and implement a determination, `setStatusToOpen`, which will be used to set a default value for the overall status of a Travel entity instance. You will use the Entity Manipulation Language (EML) to implement the transactional behavior of the Travel business object.

## Intro
>Reminder: Do not forget to replace the suffix placeholder ### with your chosen or assigned group ID in the exercise steps below.
>**About: Determinations**  
>
> A determination is an optional part of the business object behavior that modifies instances of business objects based on trigger conditions. A determination is implicitly invoked by the RAP framework if the trigger condition of the determination is fulfilled. Trigger conditions can be modify operations and modified fields.   
>  
> **Further reading**: [Determinations](https://help.sap.com/viewer/923180ddb98240829d935862025004d6/Cloud/en-US/6edb0438d3e14d18b3c403c406fbe209.html)

>**About: Entity Manipulation Language (EML)**
>
> The Entity Manipulation Language (EML) is an extension of the ABAP language which offers an API-based access to RAP business objects. EML is used to implement the transactional behavior of RAP business objects and also access existing RAP business objects from outside the RAP context.   

> PS: Some EML statements can be used in the so-called local mode - by using the [addition **`IN LOCAL MODE`**](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm) - to exclude feature controls and authorization checks. This addition can currently only be used in RAP business object implementations for the particular RAP business object itself, i. e. not for other RAP business objects.
> 
> The EML reference documentation is provided in the ABAP Keyword Documentation.   
> You can use the classic **F1 Help** to get detailed information on each statement by pressing **F1** in the ABAP editors.

### Define determination setStatusToOpen

Define the determination `setStatusToOpen` in the behavior definition of the Travel entity. This determination will be used to set the default value of the field `OverallStatus` to open (O) at the creation time new Travel instances.

 1. Go to the behavior definition of the **Travel** BO entity ![bdef icon](adt_bdef.png) **`ZRAP100_R_TravelTP_###`** and insert the following statement after the statement **`delete;`** as shown on the screenshot below:

    ```ABAP
    determination setStatusToOpen on modify { create; }
    ```

    ![Travel BO Definition](new14.png)

    **Short explanation**:  
    The statement specifies the name of the new determination, `setStatusToOpen` and `on modify` as the determination time when creating new **travel** instance (`{ create }`).

 2. Save ![save icon](adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](adt_activate.png) the changes.   

 3. Now, declare the required method in behavior implementation class with ADT Quick Fix.

    Set the cursor on the determination name **`setStatusToOpen`** and press **Ctrl+1** to open the **Quick Assist** view and select the entry **Add method for determination `setStatusToOpen` of entity `zrap100_i_travel_###`** in the view.

    As result, the `FOR DETERMINE` method **`setStatusToOpen`** will be added to the local handler class **`lcl_handler`** of the behavior pool of the **Travel** BO entity ![class icon](adt_class.png) **`ZRAP100_BP_TRAVEL_###`**.

    ![Travel BO Behavior Pool](new15.png)             

 4. Save ![save icon](adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](adt_activate.png) the changes.

 You are through with the definition of the determination.



### Implement determination setStatusToOpen

You will now implement the logic of the defined determination in the behavior pool.

 1. First check the interface of the method **`setStatusToOpen`** in the declaration part of the local handler class `lcl_handler`.

    For that, set the cursor on the method name, **`setStatusToOpen`**, press **F2** to open the **ABAP Element Info** view, and examine the full method interface.

    ![Travel BO Behavior Pool](new16.png)  

    **Short explanation**:  

     - The addition **FOR DETERMINE** indicates that the method provides the implementation of a determination and the addition **ON MODIFY** indicates the specified trigger time.

     - **IMPORTING** parameter **keys** - an internal table containing the keys of the instances the determination will be executed on
     includes all entities for which keys must be assigned    

     - Implicit **CHANGING** parameter **reported** - used to return messages in case of failure   

     Now go ahead and implement the method in the implementation part of the local handler class.

 2. Define the local constant **`travel_status`** to store the allowed value of the overall status of a **Travel** instance. Insert the following code snippet in the definition part of the local handler class **`lcl_handler`** as shown on the screenshot below.

    ```ABAP
    CONSTANTS:
      BEGIN OF travel_status,
        open     TYPE c LENGTH 1 VALUE 'O', "Open
        accepted TYPE c LENGTH 1 VALUE 'A', "Accepted
        rejected TYPE c LENGTH 1 VALUE 'X', "Rejected
      END OF travel_status.    
    ```

    ![Travel BO Behavior Pool](s3.png)

 3. Now implement the method **`setStatusToOpen`** in the implementation part of the class.

    The logic consists of the following steps:    

      1. Read the travel instance(s) of the transferred keys **(keys)** using the EML statement **READ ENTITIES**   

      2. The addition **IN LOCAL MODE** is used to exclude feature controls and authorization checks   

      3. Removed all **Travel** instances where the overall status is already set     

      4. Set the overall status to **open** **(O)** for the remaining entries using the EML statement **MODIFY ENTITIES**   

      5. Set the changing parameter **reported**   

    Insert the following code snippet in the method and replace all occurrences of the placeholder `###` with your group ID.   
    You can use the **F1 help** to get detailed information on each EML statement.

    ```ABAP
    "Read travel instances of the transferred keys
    READ ENTITIES OF ZRAP100_R_TravelTP_### IN LOCAL MODE
     ENTITY Travel
       FIELDS ( OverallStatus )
       WITH CORRESPONDING #( keys )
     RESULT DATA(travels)
     FAILED DATA(read_failed).

    "If overall travel status is already set, do nothing, i.e. remove such instances  
    DELETE travels WHERE OverallStatus IS NOT INITIAL.     
    CHECK travels IS NOT INITIAL.

    "else set overall travel status to open ('O')
    MODIFY ENTITIES OF ZRAP100_R_TravelTP_### IN LOCAL MODE
      ENTITY Travel
        UPDATE SET FIELDS
        WITH VALUE #( FOR travel IN travels ( %tky    = travel-%tky
                                              OverallStatus = travel_status-open ) )
    REPORTED DATA(update_reported).

    "Set the changing parameter
    reported = CORRESPONDING #( DEEP update_reported ).   
    ```  

    Your source code should look like this:

 4. Save ![save icon](adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](adt_activate.png) the changes.



### Preview and test enhanced travel app

You can now preview and test the changes by creating a new travel instance in the Travel app.

 1. Refresh your application in the browser using **F5** if the browser is still open, or go to your service binding **`ZRAP100_UI_TRAVEL_O4_###`** and start the Fiori elements App preview for the **Travel** entity set.

 2. Create a new **Travel** instance. The overall status should now be set automatically by the logic you just implemented.   
    The initial overall status of the created should now be set to **open** **(O)**.
