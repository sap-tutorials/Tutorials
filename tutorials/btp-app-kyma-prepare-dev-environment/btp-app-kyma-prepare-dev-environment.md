# Prepare Your Kyma Development Environment
<!-- description --> This tutorial shows you how to install tools used in this tutorial, log in to your Kyma cluster, create a namespace for your app, and create a container registry secret.

## Prerequisites
 - [Prepare for SAP BTP Development](btp-app-kyma-prepare-btp)
 - For Windows, you'll need Chocolatey. This is a package manager that will speed up and ease installation of the tools in this tutorial. See how to install Chocolatey in [Setup/Install](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup).
 - You have prepared a container registry and you've logged in to the container registry through your CLI. A container registry is a repo where you can push your docker images. SAP BTP doesn't currently provide a container registry. You can use any container registry offering as long as it can be reached from public Internet.

### Verify your @sap/cds and @sap/cds-dk versions

> ### To earn your badge for the whole mission, you will need to mark all steps in a tutorial as done, including any optional ones that you may have skipped because they are not relevant for you.

Make sure your `package.json` is using `@sap/cds 6.0.1` or newer and you have `@sap/cds-dk 6.0.1` or newer globally installed.

Run the following commands in your project directory:

1. `npm install` to install your local package.

2. `cds version` to check the globally installed `@sap/cds-dk` version and your locally installed `@sap/cds` version.

To upgrade, run the following commands in your project directory:

- `npm install @sap/cds@>=6`
- `npm install -g @sap/cds-dk@>=6`

[OPTION BEGIN [macOS]]

1. To install kubectl, run the following command:
```Shell/Bash
brew install kubectl
```
2. Check if the installation is successful:
```Shell/Bash
kubectl version --client
```
You should see a version number.

[OPTION END]
[OPTION BEGIN [Windows]]

You can install kubectl using chocolatey.

1. To install kubectl, run the following command:

[OPTION END]
[OPTION BEGIN [Linux]]

Follow the instructions for your preferred way of installing kubectl at [Install and Set Up kubectl on Linux](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).

[OPTION END]

### Install kubelogin

[OPTION BEGIN [macOS]]

To install `kubelogin`, run the following command:
```Shell/Bash
brew install int128/kubelogin/kubelogin
```
See [`kubelogin` docs](https://github.com/int128/kubelogin#setup) for more details.
[OPTION END]
[OPTION BEGIN [Windows]]

You can install `kubelogin` using chocolatey:

```Shell/Bash
choco install kubelogin
```

See [`kubelogin` docs](https://github.com/int128/kubelogin#setup) for more details.
[OPTION END]
[OPTION BEGIN [Linux]]

To install `kubelogin`, run the following command:
```Shell/Bash
brew install int128/kubelogin/kubelogin
```

See [`kubelogin` docs](https://github.com/int128/kubelogin#setup) for more details.
[OPTION END]


---
### Log in to your Kyma cluster

1. Choose `KubeconfigURL` under the **Kyma Environment** tab in your subaccount.

    <!-- border -->![Kubeconfig URL](kubeconfigURL.png)

    A file `kubeconfig.yaml` is downloaded.

    <!-- border -->![Kubeconfig yaml](kubeconfig_yaml.png)

2. Copy the `kubeconfig.yaml` file to the `~/.kube/` directory and rename it to `config`. Replace or rename any existing file with the same name.

> You can also move and rename the `kubeconfig.yaml` file from the CLI.

> 1. Rename or remove any existing file named `config` from the `~/.kube/` directory.

> 2. Run the following commands:

>     ```
>     KUBECONFIG="$HOME/.kube/config:$HOME/Downloads/kubeconfig.yaml" kubectl config view --raw >$HOME/.kube/config-new
>     mv $HOME/.kube/config-new $HOME/.kube/config
>     chmod 600 $HOME/.kube/config
>     ```
>     In case you experience problems running the commands, check Step 2: `Command Line Interpreters` from [Set Up Local Development Using VS Code](btp-app-set-up-local-development) for more details on recommended CLIs.

=== "Windows"

    There are two additional steps for Windows users only:

    3. Go to `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin`.

    4. Rename `kubelogin.exe` to `kubectl-oidc_login.exe`.

---
### Create a namespace for your app

1. Run the following command to create a namespace `risk-management`:

    ```Shell/Bash
    kubectl create namespace risk-management
    ```
   You should get a message `namespace/risk-management created`.

2. Switch context to the namespace:

    ```Shell/Bash
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace risk-management
    ```
   You should get a message `Context "shoot--kyma--X-XXXXXXX" modified.`

---
### Create container registry secret

You need the container registry secret to access docker container images in your registry from your Kyma cluster.

Kubernetes has a special type of secret for container registries and its `kubectl` command line supports it with the required options:

```Shell/Bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry container-registry \
        "--docker-server=..." \
        "--docker-username=..." \
        "--docker-email=..." \
        "--docker-password=..."
```

1. Copy the folder `scripts` from `templates/Kyma-Prepare-Dev-Environment` to your project directory.


1. Run the script to create the secret. In your project directory, execute:

    ```Shell/Bash
    ./scripts/create-container-registry-secret.sh
    ```
    Running this script will prompt you for the required inputs. By using the script, you avoid storing your password in your command line interpreter's history.

    > Can't run the `kubectl create secret docker-registry container-registry \` command?

    > If you encounter any errors running this command, make sure you are using the `Git BASH` command line interpreter, as advised in `Step 2: Command Line Interpreters` in this [tutorial](btp-app-set-up-local-development).


3. When prompted, provide the required details.

    - `Docker Server` - Use the full qualified hostname for the docker server.
    - `User` and `Email` - provide your username and e-mail that you used to create your container registry.
    - `API Key` - as part of the authentication settings of your container registry, you should be able to generate an API key and provide it here.

    > Looking for your docker server URL?

    >     The docker server URL is the path used for docker login, so you can quickly check it by running the following command in your terminal:

    >     ```json
    >     cat ~/.docker/config.json
    >     ```

4. Check if the secret was successfully created:

    ```
    kubectl get secret
    ```
    You should be able to see the newly created secret.
