## Prerequisites
 - SAP BTP trial account:
    - You must have registered for a trial account on SAP Business Technology Platform: [Get a Free Trial Account on SAP BTP](hcp-create-trial-account).
 - SAP BTP enterprise Account:
    - You have a subaccount for which you want to manage entitlements. If you need help setting up your subaccount, have a look at [Managing Subaccounts Using the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/55d0b6d8b96846b8ae93b85194df0944.html).

## Details
### You will learn
- How to add entitlements to a subaccount

You can do this tutorial with trial accounts or enterprise accounts with a global account using cloud management tools feature set B.

If you are in a global account using cloud management tools feature set A, you can also do this tutorial but be aware that some UI elements might be called differently. For more information on the two feature sets, see [Cloud Management Tools â€” Feature Set Overview](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/caf4e4e23aef4666ad8f125af393dfb2.html).


If you are in a global account using the consumption-based commercial model, you can try out services for free. To do that, you have to assign the entitlements using the **free** plan if it is available.

<div>Every service has its own available plans:<div>1. Go to [SAP Discovery Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/) to obtain information on which plans are available. To do so, search for the name of the product you are interested in.</div><div>2. Select the tile of the product you are interested in.</div><div>3. From the available tabs, select **Pricing**. You can now see all Service Plans available (such as **Free**, **Default** / **Standard** or **Trial** service plans). As an example, see the screenshot below.</div>

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Understanding entitlements and quota)]
Before you get started, you should understand the difference between entitlements and quota, because you'll encounter these two terms quite often.

- **Entitlements** are your right to provision and consume a resource. They refer to **what** you're entitled to use (e.g., which services and service plans).

- **Quota** is the numeric quantity that defines the maximum allowed consumption of that resource. In other words, **how much** of a service plan you're entitled to use.

Entitlements and quota are managed at the global account and directory levels, distributed to directories and subaccounts, and consumed by the subaccounts.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Assign entitlements)]
1. In you global account, navigate to **Entitlements** > **Entity Assignments**.
2. In the **Select Entities** selection, choose the directory or subaccount that you want to assign entitlements to.
3. Click **Go**.

    You'll see a table for the directory/ subaccount with all entitlements it already has.
4. Click **Configure Entitlements**, then select **Add Service Plans**.

    A popover appears with all entitlements available for your directory/ subaccount.

6. Select the amount of quota you need.
7. Click **Add Service Plans** to exit the popover.
