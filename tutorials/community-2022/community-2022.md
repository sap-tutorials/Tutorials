[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](SAP Community Homepage)]

Within this first step, you will be guided through the entry point of [SAP Community](https://community.sap.com), our homepage and will find out what it has to offer. SAP Community is a place for members to engage and build influence, make meaningful connections, share insights and knowledge, and develop a personal reputation in an inclusive and supportive way.

In the following, you will get an overview of the SAP Community homepage.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Your Profile)]

We want you to be an integrated part of our community, so that you can contribute and connect with other members. In order to participate fully, you need to set your profile public (via your account privacy settings). If you don't, you will still be able to read SAP Community content, but you will miss out on engaging with others and on publishing content. Learn more under [Privacy - FAQ](https://community.sap.com/resources/privacy).

1. Go to your SAP.com profile **Dashboard** (accessible by clicking your avatar in the upper right and using the **My Account** feature)

2. Select **Privacy** (found under **Account & Settings** on the left-hand side)

3. Make sure that **I want my profile to be visible to the public** is switched to **Allow**.

4. Click **View your public profile**. (A little hint: remember that step, as you will be asked later to share your public profile link with us)

**Follow Activity:** **`Follow a tag`** 

As just mentioned, you can follow a tag from the topic page to get notified (via e-mail and/or SAP Community inbox) about new content (blog posts, questions and answers) posted with that tag. You will also view this content in your [Activity Stream](https://activities.sap.com/),

1. Click the blue **Follow** button on the topic page.

    ![follow_tags](follow_tags.png)

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Groups)]

**what's new in 2022**

We are excited to introduce [Groups](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/groups/ct-p/groups) to SAP Community. Groups offer a place for connecting, sharing, and engaging with others on a particular topic or interest. It is an environment for one-on-one conversations and direct exchanges where you can participate in discussions, share your experience, get guidance and advice from fellow SAP Community members and much more.

To get full insights on the features in Groups, watch this video.

We are currently in a beta phase in which you will need to create your own profile for Groups. Group members may participate in discussions and events, publish content, comment on existing posts, and connect with community members interested in similar topics or interests. Learn more [detailed information](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/help/faqpage/title/howregister_email_verify_not_required).

Our [Welcome Corner](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/welcome-corner/gh-p/welcome-corner) is for everyone to get to know each other. Say Hi 👋🏽 to your fellow community members and reply to [this thread](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/welcome-corner-discussions/sap-community-where-are-you-from/m-p/5433) where you are from.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Questions & Answers)]

### Q&A

The [Q&A area](https://answers.sap.com/index.html) includes all the questions asked in the community on a daily basis. If you have a question, you can ask the community for help or you can see if someone asked something similar before, as the solution may already be available. If you are an expert who wants to share your knowledge and help others, you can see what kind of questions members ask. Multiple filter options can allow you to focus on your area(s) of interest.

To get full insights into the features of Q&A, watch this video.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Blogging)]

The [Blogging area](https://blogs.sap.com/) gives you the opportunity to share your professional and personal experiences, views, and insights. These may include but are not limited to how-to's, theories, and opinions organized into categories that relate to SAP subjects. Everyone's own views and learning journeys are valued. SAP Community encourages sharing knowledge and learning from each other. It brings together people from all around the world, and by learning how to write relevant content for them, you will draw a larger audience and increase readership for your blog post.

To get full insights into the features of Blogging, watch this video.
