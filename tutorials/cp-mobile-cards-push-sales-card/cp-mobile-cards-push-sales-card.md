[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Understand the use case)]

In the [previous tutorial of this group](cp-mobile-cards-create-sales-push), you created a card that will be used by the Sales Managers to Approve / Reject sales orders.

In this tutorial, you will mimic Watson's request by triggering a request from an external system. Once the request is created, Alice will receive a push notification.

    |Alias|Role|

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Make HTTP request)]

>Make sure you are choosing the preferred tab **above**: **Postman** or **cURL**.

In this step, you will make an HTTP Request. This knowledge is transferrable, i.e. you can implement this logic in your Web/Desktop/Mobile applications.

[OPTION BEGIN [Postman]]

1. Create your HTTP Request by using the following configuration:

    * **Request Type & URL**

    |HTTP Method Type|URL|
    | :--- | :--- |
    |**`POST`**|**`<The URL you copied from the service key table>/mobileservices/origin/hcpms/CARDS/v1/register/templated`**|

    * **Authorization**

    |Authorization Type|Username|Password|
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    |**`BASIC`** | **`RegisterCardServiceKey`** | **`<The API Key you copied from the service key table>`** |

    * **Headers**

    |Key|Value|
    |:---|:---|
    |`Content-Type`| `application/json` |

    * **Body - Raw &rarr; JSON**

    ```JSON
    {
      "method": "REGISTER",
      "username": "<The User Name you copied from the Push Registration table>",
      "templateName": "Sales Push Card BAS",
      "parameters": {
        "SalesOrderID": "<The Sales Order Id you copied from the Sample OData Service>"
      }
    }
    ```

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [cURL]]


1. Use Base64 encoding to encode the following:

    **`RegisterCardServiceKey:<The API Key you copied from the service key table>`**

2. Use the following cURL code to make the HTTP request. You will need to modify the text mentioned in **< >**.

```Curl
curl --location --request POST '<The URL you copied from the service key table>/mobileservices/origin/hcpms/CARDS/v1/register/templated' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <BASE_64 Encoded Value>' \
--data-raw '{
  "method": "REGISTER",
  "username": "<The User Name you copied from the Push Registration table>",
  "templateName": "Sales Order Push Card",
  "parameters": {
    "SalesOrderID": "<The Sales Order Id you copied from the Sample OData Service>"
  }
}'
```

[OPTION END]

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](View notification on device)]

>Make sure you are choosing the right device platform tab ( **Android** or **iOS** ) **above**.

> **Before proceeding, ensure that you have created a Push Card by following [this tutorial](cp-mobile-cards-create-sales-push).**
