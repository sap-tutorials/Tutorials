### Customize the theme

To design and modify the theme, you need to first define a Target Page that will serve as a canvas upon which you can perform these changes. You will then use the quick theming mode to easily change color scheme, background image, or logo.

1. Enter the **Link to Application**. This is the runtime URL of your site that you copied previously in Step 1.

2. Click **Add** to create the target page.
