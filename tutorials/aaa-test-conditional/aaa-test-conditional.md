If you installed the VM installation package to a Windows machine, follow this step to update the `etc/hosts` file.

1.   On your Windows laptop, navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`

2.   In `Administrator` mode, open `hosts` in Notepad. See your operating system Help for information on opening applications in Administrator mode

3.   In a new uncommented row, add the IP address and `hxehost`. Save your changes

    Spacing is important. Make sure your hosts file in Notepad looks like this image.
