### Understand the Toolbar

Let's first look at the toolbar. In the toolbar, you can save a copy, share with other users, add filters, navigate pages, toggle between View and Edit modes, and more.

|  Number         | Name                    | Description
|  :------------- | :-------------          | :-------------
|  1              | **File**                | Go here to export, share, schedule, and publish your story to the catalog.
|  2              | **Edit**                | Reset your story to its original view state, refresh your story data, copy, and paste widgets.
|  3              | **Tools**               | Edit Prompts for your data models, bookmark the current state of your story, run formulas on table cells, and  create Story Filters that filter data story-wide.
|  4              | **Display**             | Toggle Comment Mode and Tab Display (page navigation option) on or off. We'll use these in Step 2.
|  5              | **Quick Access Icons**  | Apply story filters, refresh data, and add bookmarks with just one click.
|  6              | **Controls**            | View all filters applied to the page and widgets.
|  7              | **Edit/View**           | Toggle between Edit and View modes. Edit mode enables a Design panel and a larger toolbar filled with features and capabilities that you can use to build stunning and interactive dashboards and reports.  Note that Edit mode is available only if you have rights to edit the story.

>If you have a Trial account, the File menu is not shown when in View mode for the Sample Story due to stricter permissions.

### Explore the Pages of a Story


To start, let's explore the options for Page Navigation. As seen below, the default mode lets you navigate the story pages through a drop-down menu.

If you'd like quicker access to all the pages, you can click on **Display** > **Tab Bar**. The screenshot below shows you an example of **Tab Bar** display in a story. Let's go through each page.

### **Sales Manager Overview**  

This page gives an overview of the performance for each sales manager.  The bar chart displays the ranking of the sales managers while the table provides detailed data into each quarter. The Input Control filters on the left help you "slice and dice" the data, allowing you to see their performance by different Products and Locations.
