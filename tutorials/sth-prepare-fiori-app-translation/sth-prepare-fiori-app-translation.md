Select root folder of the application **sample.Shop** and open the menu with a right mouse click.
Select **Project - Project Settings**.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Make project settings)]

In this step, you're going to specify the languages in which you want the app to be available (Chinese, French, and German).
In the `Project Settings` locate the **Languages tab** in section General and check that **English** is the default language.

![Make project settings](sth-8.png)

Scroll down in the Languages section to maintain the languages: **Chinese, French and German**.
