### Download Update Files


Login as `<sid>adm`. Depending on your current version of SAP HANA, express edition, you will either use the built-in update utility, or download the through the Download Manager. Your primary choice should be the built-in update utility.

* Check the update utility. It can be found in the `<sid>adm/bin` directory. For `Linux x86_64`, use `HXECheckUpdate_liux.bin`, and for `Linux PPC64`, use `HXECheckUpdate.jar`. Run one of these to check for, and download, the latest files. Follow the prompts to download the new files. By default, they will be downloaded to `/usr/sap/<sid>/home/Downloads`. The downloaded files will be `hxe.tgz`, and `hxexsa.tgz` for Applications if applicable.

* If you do not have the update utility, use the Download Manager, select Binary Installer and download the latest files for `hxe.tgz`, and `hxexsa.tgz` for Applications if applicable.



### Extract the Packages


Extract the contents of the packages.

Example:

```bash
su -l <sid>adm
tar -zxf <downloaded_path>/hxe.tgz
tar -zxf <downloaded_path>/hxexsa.tgz
```



### Update the Server Installation


Navigate to the directory where you extracted the packages:

```bash
cd <extract_path>/HANA_EXPRESS_20/
```

> Note:
> If the update you are applying includes the Applications package, increase your allocated memory by 3GB and run `./hxe_gc.sh`. Follow the prompts and then continue with the procedure.

.

As the root user, run the upgrade script to update the server:

```bash
sudo ./hxe_upgrade.sh
```

Follow the prompts to complete the server update.

>**Note**
>`hxe_upgrade.sh` detects the Server-only and Applications packages. The script will upgrade the server and XSA (if available).

>**Note**
> Upgrading is supported only for SAP HANA, express edition 2.0 SP 00 and newer.
