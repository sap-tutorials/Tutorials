# Run and Test a Project in SAP HANA Smart Data Streaming
<!-- description --> Part 7 of 9. Run and test the streaming project using Stream View, Manual Input, and Event Tracer tools.

## Prerequisites  
- **Files:** Download the [**`machinedata.csv`**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/sds-event-stream-playback/machinedata.csv) file, which will be use later for playback during testing.

## You will learn  
- Running the project that you built in the previous exercises.
- Using the Playback tool to simulate a live source and stream in data from a file at a controlled rate.
- Using the Stream Viewer to view the output from each stream/window in your project.
- Using the Manual Input tool to manually generate test events and send them into your project one at a time.
- Using the Event Tracer tool to see how an event flows through the directed graph within the project.

### Running the project


In the next steps you will run the project, play some data and view the results.

Go to **SAP HANA Streaming Development** perspective. Click the drop down arrow next to the **Run** button and select the streaming server to run this project. You will be switched into the **SAP HANA Streaming Run-Test** perspective after you have deployed and ran the project.

### Open the streams


Double-click on **`MACHINEDATA`** to open it in the **Stream View**.

Note: You won't see any data, because we haven't loaded any data yet.

![go to stream view](runandplay/2-gotostreamview.png)

Now double-click on each of the other streams/windows to open them in the **Stream View** tool.

### Use the playback tool


Click the **Playback** tab.

![playback](runandplay/4-playback.png)

Click Select Project icon in the top right corner of the **Playback** window to connect the playback tool to the current project (if you had multiple projects running it would ask you to choose).

![select project](runandplay/5-selectproject.png)

Click Select Playback File icon shown below to select the data file to use.

![select playback file](runandplay/6-selectplaybackfile.png)

If you have not downloaded the playback data already, please download the **`machinedata.csv`** file included in the prerequisites. In the Open dialogue window, change the file type to **`.csv`**. Choose **`machinedata.csv`** included in this tutorial and then click **Open**. You can also press **Alt+o**.

![open file](runandplay/7-openfile.png)

Click **rec/ms**. You want to control the playback speed so that you can watch things happen at a reasonable pace. Once it's running you can speed it up or slow it down using the slider tool. Enter `0.005` in the **rec/ms** box.

![rec per sec](runandplay/8-recpersec.png)

Then click the Start Playback button with icon shown below.

![play](runandplay/9-play.png)

Click each viewer tab to view the output from each stream/window.

### Using manual input and the event tracer tools


In the next eight steps you will use manual input and event tracer tools.

Click the **Event Tracer** tab to select it. Click on the Select Running Project button to connect to a running project. if you have multiple projects running, it would prompt you to choose one.

![open event tracer](manualinput/1-openeventtracer.png)

Click the **Manual Input** tab.

![click manual input](manualinput/2-clickmanualinput.png)

Click **Select Stream** to connect the manual input tool to the project.

![select project](manualinput/3-selectproject.png)

Click on **MACHINEDATA** and then click **OK**.

![choose project](manualinput/4-chooseproject.png)

Fill out input fields as shown in the picture. Use one of the following as the **`MACHINEID`** since these are the existing values in the `"MACHINE_REF"` table that you are using: `2DDDBW3TP`, `EKM49RTXK`, `RB82KMY3S`, `4CBH7792RN`, `JMD51RTKK`, `GGR23RTXK`, or `8HRT4WX2`. You can alter the other values. Then click Publish button to send the event.

![fill info](manualinput/5-fillinfo.png)

The colors in the **Event Tracer** (at the top  of studio) diagram shows how each stream/window in the project is affected by the event you just sent. Double-click on each node to view the output generated by that node in response to the event in the Console.

![event tracer](manualinput/6-eventtracer.png)

Click the **Stream View** tab.

![stream view](manualinput/7-streamview.png)

Find the entry that you submitted through Manual Input.
