### Build the MTA archive


Before you build the MTA Archive for deployment, do not forget to switch back the database from **in-memory `SQLite`** to **SAP HANA** (if not already). For that, just open the `package.json` file from the CAP service and set the `cds.requires.db.kind` parameter to `hana` like demonstrated below:

![Figure 1 – Switch the database back to HANA](switch-hana.png)

Now you can start the procedure to build the archive. You begin by building the CAP service.

In the **Terminal** type `cds build –-production` and press **Enter** (don't forget to press `CTRL+C` to terminate `cds watch` if it was previously running).

![Figure 2 – Build CAP service](cds-build.png)

On the **left-hand pane** right-click the `mta.yaml` file and select **Build MTA Project**.

![Figure 3 – Build MTA Project](build-mta.png)

It's going to take some seconds until the build process completes. When it does, it will display a message "**Terminal will be reused by tasks**" in a dedicated terminal named "**Task Build MTA Project**". Look for the message "**Build succeeded**" among the lines in that console to make sure the build process was successful.

![Figure 4 – Successful build](successful-build.png)

If the process is successful you'll notice that a file named `sfsf-projman_1.0.0.mtar` will be generated into a new folder named `mta_archives` like demonstrated below:

![Figure 5 – MTA Archive generated](mta-archive.png)


### Deploy the MTA Archive


> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: before  you trigger the process to deploy the MTA archive to Cloud Foundry you **MUST** make sure you **comply with two requirements**:
>
> 1. You are properly **logged to Cloud Foundry** as instructed in **step 2** of the tutorial: [**Jump start the SAP SuccessFactors Extension CAP Project**](cap-extend-sfsf-jumpstart)
> 2. Your **SAP HANA Cloud database is up and running** (remember that everything shuts down overnight on **trial accounts**!)

On the **left-hand pane** right-click the `sfsf-projman_1.0.0.mtar` file and select **Deploy MTA Archive**.

![Figure 6 – Deploy MTA Archive](deploy-mta.png)

It's going to take a while until the deployment process finishes. When it does, it will display a message "**Terminal will be reused by tasks**" in a dedicated terminal named "**Task Deploy MTA Archive**". Look for the message "**Process finished**" in the last lines and see that **there's no errors/failures listed** among the other lines in that console to make sure the deployment process was truly successful.

### Assign Admin role to your business user


Before you jump into testing the application, you must remember that it's meant for **project administrators**, meaning, users with the Admin role assigned. So, assign the role to your user in SAP BTP.

In the **SAP BTP cockpit**, on the **left-hand pane** expand the **Security** menu and click on **Role Collections**. On the right side, using the **search box**, search for the `sfsf_projman_Administrator` role and click on it.

![Figure 8 – Find Role Collection](find-role.png)

Click on the **Edit** button at the top-right corner, then, in the **Users** list, select the **Default identity provider** from the dropdown list and provide your **SAP BTP user ID** and your **e-mail** (usually in trial accounts they are both your e-mail). Click on the "**+**"" button on top of the list and then click on the **Save** button at the top-right corner.

![Figure 9 – Add user to Role Collection](add-user.png)

Now you are OK to test the application.


### Test the deployed application


On the **left-hand pane**, (1) click on **HTML5 Applications** and locate your **Business Solution** (`sfsf-projman-<your subdomain>`). Then, (2) click on the link of the **Application Name**.

![Figure 10 – Start application](launch-app.png)

An **SAP Fiori Launchpad** will open-up in a new browser tab with the **application tile** in it:

![Figure 11 – SAP Fiori Launchpad](launchpad.png)

Click on the tile and the **List Report page** for the **Project** entity will be loaded:

![Figure 12 – List Report page for Project entity](list-report.png)

Now, click on the **Go** button and the **initial test data** (loaded to the HANA database from the CSV files) will be displayed:

![Figure 13 – Initial test data displayed](test-data.png)

And that's it! You have successfully deployed a **fully working SAP Fiori Elements application** to **SAP BTP Cloud Foundry**!

You can, now, test it at your will, in the same way you did using the **Fiori Preview** in **step 6** of the tutorial: [**Prepare the SAP SuccessFactors Extension UI with CDS Annotations**](cap-extend-sfsf-ui-annotations).

Finally, the last step in the journey of this tutorial group is to add your application to a **user-driven launchpad** using **SAP BTP's Launchpad Service**.
