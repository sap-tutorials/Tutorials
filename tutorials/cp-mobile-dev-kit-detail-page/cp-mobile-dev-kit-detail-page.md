[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create the customer detail page)]

This page will show related details for a customer. In this page, you will add an **Object Header** control that is used to display information (like first name, last name, date of birth, email address & phone number) about the header of an object and **Static Key Value** control to display key value pair items like address, city, postal code & country.

1. In SAP Business Application Studio project, Right-click the **Pages** folder | **MDK: New Page** | **Section Page** | **Next**.

    !![MDK](img_1.1.png)

2. Enter the Page Name `Customers_Detail` and click **Next** and the **Finish** on the Confirmation step.

    !![MDK](img_1.2.png)

3. In the **Properties** pane set the Caption to **Customer Detail**.

    !![MDK](img-1.3.png)

4. Next, you will add an **Object Header** container to display information like first name, last name, date of birth, email address & phone number.

    In the Layout Editor, expand the **Controls** | **Container** section, drag and drop the **Object Header** control onto the page area.

    !![MDK](img-1.4.gif)

5. Now, you will replace the default values of the control's properties with the values from customer entity.

    In the Properties pane, click the **link icon** to open the Object Browser for the `BodyText` property.

    Double click the `DateOfBirth` property of the Customer entity to set it as the binding expression and click **OK**.

    !![MDK](img-1.5.gif)

6. Repeat the above steps binding below Properties:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Description` | `{CustomerId}` |
    | `DetailImage` | `sap-icon://customer` |
    | `FootNote`| `{EmailAddress}` |
    | `HeadlineText`| `{LastName}` |
    | `Status` | `{PhoneNumber}` |
    | `Subhead` | `{FirstName}` |

    >`DetailImage` property is referencing [SAP font icon](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/iconExplorer/webapp/index.html#/overview/SAP-icons).

    >Make sure to select values for the mentioned properties only from **Customer** Entity. You may find similar values from other entities. For example,

    >!![MDK](img_1.6.png)

7. As enough fields have been selected to be displayed on the detail page, `Substatus` and `Tags` are not required for this tutorial. In a real use case, you may need these properties.

    Remove the default value for `Substatus` properties.

8. Also, delete items under `Tags`.

    !![MDK](img-1.8.gif)

    Page should look like below.

    !![MDK](img-1.8.png)

9. In the main area of the page, let's display some other details like; address, city, postal code, county.

    Drag and drop a **Static Key Value** container onto the page under the **Object Header**.

    !![MDK](img-1.9.gif)

10. Expand the **Container Item** section of the Controls palette and drag and drop a **Key Value Item** onto the **Static Key Value** container on the page.

    !![MDK](img_1.10.gif)

11. Repeat the process and drag three more Key Value Items onto the **Static Key Value** section so you have a total of four when you are done.

    !![MDK](img_1.11.png)

12. Select the **upper left** Key Value Item and set the `KeyName` to **Address**.

    !![MDK](img-1.12.png)


13. For this tutorial, you will set the value as a combined binding of house number and street. You can find more details about [Target Path](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/getting-started/mdk/development/property-binding/target-path.html).

    Start with first part of the binding for **Address** property.

    Click the **link icon** next to the **Value** field to display the Object Browser and change the Format to **Binding Target Path**.

    Click the **checkbox** for _Current Object_ and double click `HouseNumber` to set it as the first part of the binding. **Don't click OK as you will set second part of the binding too.**

    !![MDK](img-1.13.gif)

    >Be careful not to select `HouseNumber` from `Address (ESPM.Address)`, final expression should be as per above animation.

    Now, set second part of the binding.

    The cursor will be at the end of binding in the Expression field. Add a space and then select **Street** property and click **Insert**.

    Click **OK** to set the binding.

    !![MDK](img-1.13.1.gif)

    >Be careful not to double click **Street** as that will replace the existing expression with just the Street property.

    >**Street** should be selected from **Customer** entity.

14. Select the **upper right** Key Value Item and set the `KeyName` to **City**.

    Click the link icon to display the Object Browser. Change the format to **Binding** and double click the **City** property of the Customer entity to set it as the binding expression.

    Click **OK** to set the binding.

    !![MDK](img-1.14.1.gif)

    >Be careful not to select **City** from `Customer.Address (ESPM.Address)` collection, final expression should be as per above screenshot.

15. Repeat the process and set the **lower left** Key Value Item Key Name to **Postal Code** and bind the value to the `PostalCode` entity property.

16. Repeat the process and set the **lower right** Key Value Item Key Name to **Country** and bind the value to the `Country` entity property.

    >Be careful not to select _Postal Code_ & _City_ from Customer.Address (ESPM.Address) collection, final expression should be as per below screenshot.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Set the OnPress of the customer list)]

In the`Customers_List.page` , you will set the `OnPress` event of the Contact Cell table control. You will link the Contact Cell table control to the `NavToCustomers_Detail.action` so that when an end-user selects a customer, the Customer Detail page will open. MDK automatically passes the selected customer to the detail page.

1. In `Customers_List page`, select the **Contact Cell Table** control, **click** the 3 dots icon under the **Events** tab for the `OnPress` property to click the **Object Browser**.

2. Double click the `NavToCustomers_Detail.action` and click **OK** to set it as the `OnPress` Action.
