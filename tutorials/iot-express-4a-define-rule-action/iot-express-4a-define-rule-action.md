## Prerequisites  
 - **Tutorials:** [Create a Simple IoT Device Model](iot-express-2-create-device-model) and [Create Thing Model](iot-express-4-create-thing-model)
 - **Configuration** You or someone else that is an administrator in your global account has walked through the following end-to-end configuration and onboarding guide: [Getting Started with SAP Leonardo IoT](https://help.sap.com/viewer/195126f4601945cba0886cbbcbf3d364/latest).


## Details
### You will learn
  - How to define and create a rule
  - How to activate a rule
  - How to create a rule context
  - How to set up an Email server
  - How to create an action to send an Email notification

---

In this tutorial, you will define a rule to check if the temperature is too high. If this is the case, an email should be sent.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Configure your Mail Server (SMTP))]

1.	On the launchpad, choose the **Settings - Configure Mail Server** tile.

    ![Set up Email Server](Notifications-Email.png)

2.	Enter the **SMTP Server Port** and **SMTP Server host** address. The example shows Google server host detail.

3.	Enter the **SMTP Server Authentication User** and **SMTP Server Authentication Password**.

4.	Enter the email address of the notification sender in the **Notification Sender Email Address** field.

5.	Enter the default subject of the notification in the **Default Notification Address** field.

6.	Choose **Save** to save your change.

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create a rule context)]
The rule context defines the data objects that can be used in a rule. Currently, this is one property set. In the future, several data objects could be defined as part of a Rule Context.

1. From the launchpad, choose the **Rule Contexts** tile.

2. Choose **New**.

3. Set **Name** for the rule context to `envData` for `Greenhouse`. Optionally, you can also enter a **Short Text** and a **Description**.

    ![New Rule Context](NewRule-Context.png)

4. Under **Data Objects > Thing Data - Property Sets**, click **Add**.

5. In the popup window, for **Package**, select your package, for example `greenhouse`. For **Thing Type**, select your thing type, for example `greenhouseType`.

6. Choose the property set `envData` for the new rule context and click **OK**.

    ![Select Property Set](Select-PropertySet.png)

    The system immediately associates the selected property set with the rule context and navigates you back to the rule context detail screen.

7. Click the `envData` property set to check the properties and details. When done, click **Close**.

8. Choose **Save**.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Create a rule)]

In this step, you define a streaming rule that should be triggered whenever a temperature exceeds a given value.

There are 3 types of rules today:

-	**Streaming Cloud Rules** are executed immediately when measurements arrive in the system via SAP Cloud Platform Internet of Things for the Cloud Foundry Environment. A rule is executed on each individual incoming measurement in the defined rule context (that is, property set).

- **Scheduled Rules** are executed by schedule defined by the user. The Scheduled Rules work based on the Time Series Aggregates (see https://help.sap.com/viewer/080fabc6cae6423fb45fca7752adb61e/latest/en-US/8e70388fc8814b77a7c0567de93a035e.html). Using Scheduled Rules, you can express rules on aggregated time series data for a specific time window, like the maximum temperature in 24 hours.

In this tutorial, you will make a streaming rule.

1. From the launchpad, click the **Rules** tile.

2. Choose **New Rule**.

3. From the menu, choose **Streaming Cloud** for the type of the rule that you want to create.

    The system presents an empty detail screen where you can enter the settings for the new rule on the **General Information** page.

    ![Activate a New Rule](New-Rule.png)

4. Set **Name** to **`Temperature above 70`** for the rule. Optionally, you can also enter a **Short Text** and **Description**.

5. Optionally, you may define a set of freely defined **Tags** that you can attach to a rule.

6. When done with the **General Information**, move on to the **Definition** tab.

7. From the list of **Rule Contexts**, select your rule context, for example, `envData for Greenhouse`.

8. Once you have selected your rule context it will open another window to select the property set for this rule context.

    Click `envData` to select as example here.

    ![General Information for a New Rule](NewRule-GeneralInfo.png)

    The system informs you that the rule context cannot be changed anymore, once it has been assigned to a rule. Confirm the information to assign the rule context. The system automatically displays the Thing Type to which the rule context belongs.

    ![Rule Editor](RuleEditor-Step1.png)

9. In the **Rule Definition** section, define the **If** condition that the rule shall test. For example, `temperature of the envData is greater than 70`.

    >**Hint:** Entering a space in the **If** condition will give you a context dialog that enables you to select the right object or operator of the rule. By this way, you cannot enter an erroneous rule.

10. Set **IoT Event Name** to **`High Temperature`** and **IoT Event Severity** to **`Medium`**.

    >**Hint:** The event name that you can use in the action to give a meaningful context. To set the **Event Severity**, use **`Low`**, **`Medium`** or **`High`**.

    ![Rule Editor to Set Temperature Details](RuleEditor-Step2.png)

11. Click **Save**. The system goes back to the rule list view.

12. Select the rule from the list, and click **Activate**.

    You also have an option to **Activate** the rule while you are in the rule definition screen in the previous step where you saved.

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Create action to send email)]

In the final step, you define an action that sends an email.

1.	On the launchpad, select the **Actions** tile.

2.	On the **Actions** page, choose **New** to create a new action.

    ![Send Email Notification](Email-Notification.png)

3.	Set the **Name** field to `Email Alert: high temperature is detected`.

4.	Enter the **Description** optionally.

5.	In the **Trigger by** field, select **Event from Rule**.

6.	In the **Rule** dropdown, select `Temperature above 70`.
    The system populates `Thing Type` automatically.

7.	In the **Action Type** dropdown, select `Email Notification`.

8.	Enter value in the **Email Information** fields. Hint: By entering `"${"` + another letter(s), you will get a context menu with variables that you can use in the notification text.

9.	Choose **Save** to save your change.

10. Once saved you can see your Action in the list view. In your action right corner you can see **Details**. Click on it, a new popup window appears. This is basically to show the last 10 errors that occurred while this Action was triggered.

    ![Show Email Notification Error Details](Email-Notification-Error-Details.png)

11.	Click on your Action, Action detail window will open. In the upper right corner you can see **Test** button. You can test your Action once created and saved by providing the `Thing ID` of the associated `Thing Type`.

    ![Show Email Notification Test](Email-Notification-Test.png)

Further notification types supported are http calls to another system, for instance, for business process integration, or an in-app notification to show up in a user's Fiori Launchpad.

For http calls, there exist 2 sample payloads that fit to sample CPI content provided for the integration scenarios **Service Ticket** and **Purchase Requisition**. These sample payloads only work together with the respective CPI content. However, they can serve as an example for your concrete integration scenario.

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Test rule)]

To test your rule --> ingest data from IoT service:

1.	Pick the device mapped to `greenhouse1`.

2.	Ingest a value of 75 for temperature.

3.	You will get an email.

    ```
    To: mytest@email.com

    Subject: Alert: high temperature at greenhouse1

    Body:

    To whom it may concern,

    It is detected that greenhouse1 is having a high temperature at 75.

    Please check.

    Thanks
    ```
