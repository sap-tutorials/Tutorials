### Configuring the Web Service Provider to Use REST Posts

The Web Services Provider (WSP) exposes an HTTP interface that grants client applications access to and several capabilities in smart data streaming and its projects. The provider supports `REST`, `SOAP`, and `WebSocket` connections.

For higher performance and better scalability, it is recommended that you use the Streaming Web Service.

First, access HANA Cockpit using the URL given during installation, in the form `https://<hostname>:<port>.`

![Cockpit Login](cockpit_login.png)

Navigate to the SAP HANA System overview, and scroll down to the **Streaming Analytics** tile, and select **Configure Streaming Cluster**.

![Streaming Analytics Tile](sds_tile.png)

Select the **Web Services Provider** tab.

![Web Services Provider Tab](wsp_tab.png)

Set the properties for the Web Services Provider. For specific information regarding each property, visit the appendix section of this tutorial.

To configure WSP to use `REST` Posts,
**a.** Set the *enable* attribute of **Web Services Provider Enabled** to be true (i.e. check the box).

**b.** Set the value of **Protocol** to be `HTTP` or `HTTPS`.

**c.** Set the value of the `REST` Port of ne `9091`

![REST Configuration](rest_config.png)

**d.** If you selected `HTTPS` for **Protocol**, specify the **keystore type**, **file** and **password** in the **Security** section.

### Configuring the Web Service Provider to Use WebSockets


Open up HANA Cockpit, similar to Step 1, and navigate to **Streaming Analytics** > **Configure Streaming Cluster** > **Web Services Provider**.

To configure the Web Service Provider to user `WebSockets`,
**a.** Similar to Step 1, set **Web Services Provider Enabled** to be true.

**b.** Set the value of **Protocol** to be `HTTP` or `HTTPS`.

![Set Up for WSP](webservicesprovider.png)

**c.** Enable the smart data streaming `WebSocket` Provider by setting **`WebSocket` Enabled:** to be true.

**d.** Set properties for the `WebSocket` Provider in its section (This is optional. The default values will work fine):

|Property|	Description|
|---|---|
|`Websocket` Enabled| Enables `WebSocket` connections. Default is checked.|
|`Websocket` Port|The port number that the Web Services Provider uses for `WebSocket` connections.|
|Publish Socket Loading| The maximum number of remote connections that can publish data over a single connection to smart data streaming. If the limit is exceeded, then a new publisher connection is created.|
|`Websocket` Secured| Specifies whether to use HTTP or HTTPS as the protocol. If set to true, the protocol is HTTPS.|
|Subscribe Socket Loading|The maximum number of remote connections that can subscribe to data over a single connection from smart data streaming. If the limit is exceeded, then a new subscriber connection is created.|
|`Websocket` TLS|Sets one or more TLS versions for `WebSocket` connections. Accepted values are `TLSv1.0`, `TLSv1.1`, and `TLSv1.2`. To specify multiple `TLS` versions, use semicolons to separate each element. For example: `TLSv1;TLSv1.1;TLSv1.2`. If not set, the value defaults to `TLSv1.2.`|

### Starting and Stopping the WSP

Previous to running the WSP, ensure you have one of the following:
- The `execute service service wsp` permission.
- The `start service service wsp` permission.

Navigate to the SAP HANA System overview, and scroll down to the **Streaming Analytics** tile, and select **Manage Streaming Nodes**.

![Manage Streaming Nodes](manage_streaming_nodes.png)

Select your node in the left navigation pane, and choose the **WSP** tab.

![Select Node](select_node.png)

In the bottom right corner of the page, select Start or Stop.

### Appendix

The general properties section contains properties for `REST`, `SOAP`, and `WebSocket` connections:

|Property|	Description|
|---|---|
|Web Services Provider Enabled| Enables the Web Services Provider. Default is checked.|
|Allow Origin|Contains a URL pointing to the default host, which stops the resource from being shared with other requesters from other origins. This restricts the response header of Access-Control--Allow-Origin for REST APIs. Specifying a value of * allows all origins. Only one URL can be specified, a list is not permitted.|
|`Autostart` Enabled | If enabled, starts the Web Services Provider automatically with the cluster. Default is unchecked.|
|Default Workspace|The default workspace associated with the cluster.|
|Max. Form Content Size|The maximum allowable size, in bytes, for a REST request. This value should be a positive integer. If you specify a negative number, the `Jetty` default value of 200,000 bytes is used instead. Any invalid values result in an integer parsing exception.|
|Monitor Interval (seconds)|The interval, in seconds, between heartbeat checks from the cluster to the Web Services Provider.|
|Monitor Timeout (seconds)|The time, in seconds, for the cluster to wait for a response to a heartbeat check before timing out.|
|Protocol|If SSL is enabled, set the protocol to HTTPS. If SSL is disabled, set the protocol to HTTP.|
|Project Loading|The maximum number of socket connections (either publish or subscribe) to smart data streaming to create for each project instance.|
|REST Port|The port number that the Web Services Provider uses for REST connections.|
|SOAP Port|The port number that the Web Services Provider uses for SOAP connections.|
|TLS|Sets one or more TLS versions for SOAP connections. Accepted values are `TLSv1.0`, T`LSv1.1`, and `TLSv1.2`. To specify multiple TLS versions, use semicolons to separate each element. </br> For example: `TLSv1;TLSv1.1;TLSv1.2.` If not set, the value defaults to `TLSv1.2`.|
|Cache Size|Specifies the number of published rows the Web Services Provider caches internally before sending them on to smart data streaming in a batch. The default value is 10.|
|Trace	|Specifies the logging level for the Web Services Provider. The logging levels in increasing order of severity are: `TRACE, DEBUG, INFO`, and `WARNING`. The default value is `INFO`.|


The `WebSocket` section contains properties for `WebSocket` connections:

|Property|	Description|
|---|---|
|`Websocket` Enabled| Enables `WebSocket` connections. Default is checked.|
|`Websocket` Port|The port number that the Web Services Provider uses for `WebSocket` connections.|
|Publish Socket Loading| The maximum number of remote connections that can publish data over a single connection to smart data streaming. If the limit is exceeded, then a new publisher connection is created.|
|`Websocket` Secured| Specifies whether to use HTTP or HTTPS as the protocol. If set to true, the protocol is HTTPS.|
|Subscribe Socket Loading|The maximum number of remote connections that can subscribe to data over a single connection from smart data streaming. If the limit is exceeded, then a new subscriber connection is created.|
|`Websocket` TLS|Sets one or more TLS versions for `WebSocket` connections. Accepted values are `TLSv1.0`, `TLSv1.1`, and `TLSv1.2`. To specify multiple `TLS` versions, use semicolons to separate each element. For example: `TLSv1;TLSv1.1;TLSv1.2`. If not set, the value defaults to `TLSv1.2.`|

The Thread Pool section sets properties for `Jetty`, used for `REST`, `SOAP`, and `WebSocket` connections:

|Property	|Description|
|---|---|
|Thread Pool Idle Timeout|The amount of time, in milliseconds, that a thread needs to idle before becoming eligible for stopping. The default value is 30000.|
|Max. Number of Threads|The maximum number of threads that `Jetty` may spawn to service incoming connections. The default value is 500.|
|Min. Number of Threads| The minimum number of threads you want `Jetty` to spawn. The default value is 20.|

The Publisher section sets optional publishing properties for `WebSocket` connections:

|Property	|Description|
|---|---|
|Publish Block Mode|(Required if **Publish Options Enabled** is checked)</br></br>When publishing is buffered, use this property to specify the publishing block mode. Valid values are `none`, `explicit`, and `auto`. Explicit lets you control the batches by using start transaction and end block calls, and auto ignores these calls and batches rows internally. The default mode is auto (auto-blocking).|
|Publish Block Size|(Required if **Publish Options Enabled** is checked) </br></br> The provider only uses this value if the publish block mode is explicit. Specifies the number of rows inside a message block. Recommended values are 64 to 1024.|
|Publish Buffer Size|(Required if **Publish Options Enabled** is checked) </br></br> Specify a positive number to enable buffered publishing. When publishing is buffered, the data is first written to an internal queue. This is picked up by a publishing thread and then written to the smart data streaming project. This is the default operating mode.|
|Publish Options Enabled|Check to enable these advanced publisher options for `WebSocket` connections.|
|Publish Use Transactions|(Required if **Publish Options Enabled** is checked) </br></br> If set to true, the provider uses transaction blocks instead of envelopes. The default value is false.|


The Subscriber section sets optional subscribing properties for `WebSocket` connections:

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|Subscribe Base Drain Timeout|(Required if **Subscribe Options Enabled** is checked) </br></br> Specify how long, in milliseconds, smart data streaming waits for a subscriber to read all base data. If there are multiple client connections sharing a subscription to smart data streaming, all connections are dropped if the Web service client is slow.|
|Subscribe Droppable|(Required if **Subscribe Options Enabled** is checked)</br></br>Specify a positive number to enable buffered publishing. When publishing is buffered, the data is first written to an internal queue. This is picked up by a publishing thread and then written to the smart data streaming project. This is the default operating mode.|
|Subscribe Options Enabled|Check to enable these advanced publisher options for `WebSocket` connections.|
|Subscribe Queue Size|(Required if **Subscribe Options Enabled is checked**)</br></br>Specify a positive number to enable buffered publishing. When publishing is buffered, the data is first written to an internal queue. This is picked up by a publishing thread and then written to the smart data streaming project. This is the default operating mode.|

If you are using HTTPS, fill out the properties in the Security section. If you are using HTTP, this section is ignored. You can set security options for `REST`, `SOAP`, and `WebSocket` connections:

|Property	|Description|
|---|---|
|Cipher File|Path to a cipher file for encrypting keystore passwords.|
|Keystore File|Path to a keystore file containing a private key, typically a `Java Keystore` (JKS).|
|Keystore Password Encrypted|Indicates whether the keystore password is encrypted.|
|Keystore Password|The password for the keystore file, which can be encrypted. If encrypted, provide a symmetric cipher to decrypt the password in the Cipher File field.|
