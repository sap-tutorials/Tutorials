In this group of tutorials our goal is to create a launchpad site using the SAP Launchpad service. But before we can do this, there are some steps you'll need to do in the SAP BTP cockpit.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Subscribe to the SAP Launchpad service)]

Before you can access the SAP Launchpad service, you first need to subscribe to it.

1. [Log onto SAP BTP](https://cockpit.hanatrial.ondemand.com) and click **Go To Your Trial Account**.

    ![Enter trial account](1_enter_trial_account.png)

    >If this is your first time accessing your trial account, you'll have to configure your account by choosing a region (select the region closest to you). Your user profile will be set up for you automatically.

    >Wait until your account is set up and ready to go. Your global account, your subaccount, your organization, and your space are launched. This may take a couple of minutes.  

2. Click **Continue** if you get this popup.

3. Click the **trial** tile to navigate to your trial subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit. If you're using your own subaccount, you can select it instead.

      ![Open trial account](3_open_subaccount.png)

4. Click **Go to Marketplace**. Alternatively, you can navigate to the service marketplace by clicking on the  **Services** menu item and selecting **Service Marketplace**.

    > The Service Marketplace provides you access to all services and applications that you can access from the SAP BTP cockpit.

5. Enter `launchpad` in the search box and click the **Launchpad Service** tile.

    >If you aren't able to find the **Launchpad Service** tile, or if you can't access it, you may be using an older trial account. You can easily add it to your account via the **Entitlements** area. Click **Configure Entitlements** and then **Add Service Plans**. Then search for `launchpad`, check the standard plan, and click **Add 1 Service Plan**. Don't forget to save in the next screen.

6. From the **Overview** tab on the right, click the Actions icon (...) and select **Create** in the opened menu to create a new subscription.

    ![Create subscription](6-create-subscription.png)

    >You can also use the **Create** button at the top right of the screen.

7. In the **New Instance or Subscription** dialog box that opens, leave the basic information that appears there and click **Create**.

    >This step will redirect you to the **Services** -> **Instances and Subscriptions** screen. This screen provides you with an overview of all services and applications that are currently active.

9. From the **Instances and Subscriptions** screen, under the **Subscriptions** tab or in the **Overview** section, you'll see that you are subscribed to the **Launchpad Service**.

1. Click **Security > Trust Configuration** from the side menu.
