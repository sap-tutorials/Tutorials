# Create a User, Tables and Import Data Using SAP HANA HDBSQL
<!-- description --> Use the command line tool HDBSQL to connect to a SAP HANA database, create a user, and create tables which will be used in subsequent tutorials in this mission.

## Prerequisites
 - You have completed the first 2 tutorials in this mission.

## You will learn
  - How to connect to SAP HANA from a client machine using HDBSQL
  - How to create a user, schema, tables and import data

## Intro
HDBSQL is used in this tutorial as it is part of the SAP HANA client install.  HDBSQL is a basic tool for executing SQL scripts and providing an interface for interactive queries.  Another more user-friendly option to execute SQL operations is the [SAP HANA database explorer](group.hana-cloud-get-started) which is part of a HANA Cloud instance or a server + applications SAP HANA, express edition install.

### Connect to SAP HANA using hdbsql


This step demonstrates how to connect to a SAP HANA instance using [HDBSQL](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f1b440ded6144a54ada97ff95dac7adf/latest/en-US/c22c67c3bb571014afebeb4a76c3d95d.html) from the SAP HANA client installation.

1. Copy and paste the following command to see the command line options and press the space bar to advance though the information.  

    ```Shell
    hdbsql -h | more
    ```

2. Connect to either SAP HANA Cloud or SAP HANA, express edition using host, port, and credentials.  Details on where to find these values are covered in the third and fifth steps of the [first tutorial](hana-clients-choose-hana-instance) in this mission.   

    - To connect to SAP HANA Cloud, see the following general command.  
    >The connection must be encrypted (-e).  Starting with the 2.6 SAP HANA client, connections on port 443 enable encryption by default so the -e parameter is not needed for SAP HANA Cloud connections.

        ```Shell
        hdbsql -n <host name>:<port> -u <user> -p <password>
        ```

        The following is a connection example for the SAP HANA Cloud.  

        ```Shell
        hdbsql -n 3b2gf55e-4214-4bd9-adfc-f547d8e2d384.hana.trial-us10.hanacloud.ondemand.com:443 -u DBADMIN -p your_password
        ```

        > The HANA Cloud instance can be configured to enable applications running from outside the SAP BTP to connect.  The current setting is shown in SAP HANA Cloud Central in the screenshot below.  An example of configuring this setting is shown in [Allow connections to SAP HANA Cloud instance from selected IP addresses â€” using the command line](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/30/allow-connections-to-sap-hana-cloud-instance-from-selected-ip-addresses-using-the-command-line/).

        > ![screenshot showing the allowlist](allowlist.png)


        >---

        >The SAP HANA Cloud, HANA database trial instance will be automatically stopped overnight.   That means you need to restart your instance before working with it each new day.

        >---

        > Connections to a HANA Cloud instance must use encryption.  The default encryption library on Windows is mscrypto and on Linux and macOS it is OpenSSL.  The following example demonstrates how one could use the SAP provided conmmoncrypto library instead of the default encryption library.  Note, the following steps require that the SAP HANA Client be downloaded from the SAP Software Downloads as the download includes the SAP Common Crypto library (libsapcrypto).  Note that the environment variables can also be set by running source hdbclienv.sh or hdbclienv.bat.

        >```Shell (Linux or Mac)
        mkdir ~/.ssl
        # Download the public root certificate used by HANA Cloud
        wget --no-check-certificate https://dl.cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem -O ~/.ssl/DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem
        # Show the command help for the sapgenpse

        # macOS only
        export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/sap/hdbclient
        # Create a PSE (Personal Security Environment) which will be used to contain the public root certificate of SAP HANA Cloud.  
        # Press enter twice to not provide a pin
        sapgenpse gen_verify_pse -p "$SECUDIR/sapcli.pse"
        >```

        >```Shell (Linux or Mac)
        # Add the certificate to the PSE
        sapgenpse maintain_pk -p "$SECUDIR/sapcli.pse" -a ~/.ssl/DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem
        # View the contents of the PSE
        sapgenpse maintain_pk -p "$SECUDIR/sapcli.pse" -l
        # Connect using the SAP commoncrypto library rather than OpenSSL.
        hdbsql -sslprovider commoncrypto -n 3b2gf55e-4214-4bd9-adfc-f547d8e2d384.hana.trial-us10.hanacloud.ondemand.com:443 -u DBADMIN -p Hana1234

        >
        >Starting with the 2.6 SAP HANA client, if the root certificate is available to OpenSSL, it is no longer required to also be in `trust.pem`.

    - For SAP HANA, express edition, there are two options shown below to connect.

        ```Shell
        hdbsql -n <ip address>:39015 -u <user> -p <password>
        or
        hdbsql -n <ip address> -d <database name> -i <instance number> -u <user> -p <password>
        ```

        Below are two connection examples for SAP HANA, express edition.

        ```Shell
        hdbsql -n <ip address>:39015 -u SYSTEM -p your_password
        or
        hdbsql -n <ip address> -d HXE -i 90 -u SYSTEM -p your_password
        ```

        Notice that either the host and port combination or the host, database name and instance number can be used to connect.

3. Type `\s` for status information

    ```Shell
    \s
    ```

    Notice that for the SAP HANA Cloud instance, the version number is 4.x.  

    ![Connect to HANA Cloud](Connect-to-host-server-cloud.png)


    Notice that for the HANA, express edition, the version number is 2.x.  

    ![Connect to HXE](Connect-to-host-server.png)  


### Create user and schema


This step creates a user named `USER1`.  `USER1` will be the owner of the tables that will be created in a subsequent steps and will be used to connect to the database.

On Linux or a Mac, turn off page by page scroll output.  Also, consult the `-j` `hdbsql` option.  This enables multiple commands to be pasted at one time and does not require each result to be exited by pressing q.  

```HDBSQL (Linux or Mac)
\pa off
```

1. Create `USER1`.  Select the command below based on the version of SAP HANA being used.  Note that the message  _'0 rows affected'_ means that query was successful.

    ```SQL
    CREATE USER USER1 PASSWORD Password1 no force_first_password_change;
    ```

    >The end of this tutorial contains SQL statements to delete the user, schema and objects created.  This may be helpful if you wish to recreate the sample dataset used in this tutorial.

    To verify that the user was created, enter the following command.
    ```SQL
    SELECT USER_NAME FROM USERS;
    ```

    Also notice that a schema with the same name is created for this user.  

    ```SQL
    SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM SCHEMAS;
    ```

2. Enable `USER1` the ability to create schema, connect as `USER1`, create a schema, and set it as the current schema.

    ```SQL
    SELECT CURRENT_USER, CURRENT_SCHEMA FROM DUMMY;
    GRANT CREATE SCHEMA TO USER1;
    CONNECT USER1 PASSWORD Password1;
    CREATE SCHEMA HOTEL;
    SET SCHEMA HOTEL;
    SELECT CURRENT_USER, CURRENT_SCHEMA FROM DUMMY;
    ```

    Notice that the current user and schema have also changed from `DBADMIN` or `SYSTEM` to `USER1` and that the schema is now HOTEL.

For further information on SQL to create a user or schema, see [CREATE USER Statement](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c1d3f60099654ecfb3fe36ac93c121bb/latest/en-US/20d5ddb075191014b594f7b11ff08ee2.html), [CREATE SCHEMA Statement](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c1d3f60099654ecfb3fe36ac93c121bb/latest/en-US/20d4ecad7519101497d192700ce5f3df.html),
[Grant Statement(Access Control)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c1d3f60099654ecfb3fe36ac93c121bb/latest/en-US/20f674e1751910148a8b990d33efbdc5.html), and  [Privileges](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c82f8d6a84c147f8b78bf6416dae7290/latest/en-US/fb0f9b103d6940f28f3479b533c351e9.html).



### Store connection details in secure user store (hdbuserstore)


Remembering and entering IP addresses, ports, user IDs and passwords can be difficult. [SAP HANA User Store](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f1b440ded6144a54ada97ff95dac7adf/latest/en-US/708e5fe0e44a4764a1b6b5ea549b88f4.html) offers a convenient means of storing this information and making it available to the SAP HANA client interfaces.

1. Exit out of `hdbsql` and type `hdbuserstore` to see a list of available commands such as Set, List and Delete.

    ```Shell
    \q
    hdbuserstore
    ```
    `hdbuserstore` is included with the install of the SAP HANA client.

2. Using `hdbuserstore`, specify a key named `USER1UserKey` that has the host, port and credentials.  Details on where to find these values are covered in the third and fifth steps of the [first tutorial](hana-clients-choose-hana-instance) in this mission.

    ```Shell
    hdbuserstore Set USER1UserKey <host name>:<port> USER1 Password1
    hdbuserstore List
    ```

3. Connect with `USER1` as the username.  

    ```Shell
    hdbsql -U USER1UserKey
    ```

    > Uppercase U is for specifying a key from the user store, lower case u is for user.  

    >---

    > Starting with the 2.6 SAP HANA client, connections on port 443 enable encryption by default so the `-e or -attemptencrypt` parameters are not needed for SAP HANA Cloud connections.

[Using Stored Connection Information](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f1b440ded6144a54ada97ff95dac7adf/latest/en-US/708e5fe0e44a4764a1b6b5ea549b88f4.html) contains details on how an application can use a `hdbuserstore` key.



### Create tables and insert data


1. Exit HDBSQL by entering \q.

2. Create a folder for the exercises in this tutorial, enter that directory, and begin editing a file named `hotel.sql`.
    ```Shell (Microsoft Windows)
    mkdir %HOMEPATH%\HANAClientsTutorial\sql
    cd %HOMEPATH%\HANAClientsTutorial\sql
    notepad hotel.sql
    ```

    Substitute `pico` below for your preferred text editor.  

    ```Shell (Linux or Mac)
    mkdir -p $HOME/HANAClientsTutorial/sql
    cd $HOME/HANAClientsTutorial/sql
    pico hotel.sql
    ```

3. Copy the following SQL into the file `hotel.sql`.  

    ```SQL
    SET SCHEMA HOTEL;
    CREATE COLUMN TABLE HOTEL(
      hno INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      name NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      address NVARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,

      FOREIGN KEY (hno) REFERENCES HOTEL
    );
    CREATE COLUMN TABLE CUSTOMER(
      cno INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      title NVARCHAR(7),
      firstname NVARCHAR(20),
      name NVARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
      address NVARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
      zip NVARCHAR(6)
    );
    CREATE COLUMN TABLE RESERVATION(
      resno INTEGER NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
      rno INTEGER NOT NULL,
      cno INTEGER,
      hno INTEGER,
      type NVARCHAR(6),
      arrival DATE NOT NULL,
      departure DATE NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (
        "RESNO", "ARRIVAL"
      ),
      FOREIGN KEY(hno) REFERENCES HOTEL,
      FOREIGN KEY(cno) REFERENCES CUSTOMER
    );
    CREATE COLUMN TABLE MAINTENANCE(
      mno INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      hno INTEGER,
      description NVARCHAR(100),
      date_performed DATE,
      performed_by NVARCHAR(40)
    );

4. Execute the SQL with the command below.  This is an example of running commands in non-interactive mode.

    ```Shell
    hdbsql -U USER1UserKey -I hotel.sql
    ```

    Confirm that 15 records have been inserted.  

    ```Shell
    hdbsql -U USER1UserKey "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM HOTEL.CUSTOMER";
    ```

    View the list of created objects.

    ```SQL
    \dt HOTEL.
    \dp HOTEL.
    ```

    > ### Some Tips

    >Identifiers such as table names are automatically upper cased unless they are within "".  
    >
    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM HoTeL.RoOm;  --succeeds
    SELECT * FROM "HoTeL"."RoOm"; --fails
    SELECT * FROM "HOTEL"."ROOM"; --succeeds
    ```

    >For further details, consult [Identifiers and case sensitivity](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c1d3f60099654ecfb3fe36ac93c121bb/latest/en-US/209f5020751910148fd8fe88aa4d79d9.html?q=case#loio209f5020751910148fd8fe88aa4d79d9__identifiers_case).

    >Should you wish to remove the contents of a table, the table itself, a schema or a user, the following statements can be executed.  Do not execute these now as `USER1` and the hotel data set will be used subsequently in this tutorial.  

    >```SQL
    DELETE FROM HOTEL.CITY;
    DROP TABLE HOTEL.CITY;
    DROP SCHEMA HOTEL CASCADE;
    DROP USER USER1 CASCADE;
    >```


### Interactive, non-interactive, substitution variables, and prepared statements


1. HDBSQL can [run commands](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f1b440ded6144a54ada97ff95dac7adf/latest/en-US/6097e699826343d0879244185d680a0d.html) interactively, or non-interactively.  A few examples are shown below.

    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.CUSTOMER; -- interactive
    hdbsql -U USER1UserKey "SELECT * FROM HOTEL.CUSTOMER"; -- non-interactive
    hdbsql -U USER1UserKey -I hotel.sql -- batch file
    ```

2. [Substitution variables](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f1b440ded6144a54ada97ff95dac7adf/latest/en-US/18ce51f468bc4cfe9112e6be79953e93.html) can used to pass parameters.  

    Given the following file:

    ```SQL (find_customers.sql)
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.CUSTOMER WHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE '&nameParam'
    ```

    It could be called using:

    ```Shell
    hdbsql -A -U user1UserKey -V nameParam=J% -I find_customers.sql
    ```

    ![example of substitution parameters](subst.png)

    It is also possible to define new variables and list the defined variables as shown below.

    ```SQL
    \vd titleParam Mr
    \vl
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.CUSTOMER WHERE TITLE = '&titleParam' AND FIRSTNAME LIKE '&nameParam'
    ```

    ![further example of substitution parameters](subst2.png)

    See [SAP HANA HDBSQL Options](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_CLIENT/f1b440ded6144a54ada97ff95dac7adf/c24d054bbb571014b253ac5d6943b5bd.html) for details on the options to list and define substitution variables.

3. As of version 2.13, HDBSQL will prompt for required parameters.  A few examples follow.

    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM HOTEL.CUSTOMER WHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE ?;
    ```

    ```SQL
    CALL HOTEL.SHOW_RESERVATIONS(?, ?);
    ```

    ![Prompting for parameters](prepared.png)

    In the above examples, the statements are prepared first, then the parameters are sent afterwards during the execute phase whereas, in the previous step, which used substitution variables, there is no separate prepare step.  If a statement is going to be executed repeatedly, but with different parameters, in general, prepared statements can execute quicker.

### Knowledge check

Congratulations! You have now created a user and some tables using HDBSQL.  This user will be used to connect and query the data in the following tutorials.
