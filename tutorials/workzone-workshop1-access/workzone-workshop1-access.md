## Prerequisites
To follow the trainings, the instructor will give you the following:
 - A URL to a SAP BTP subaccount used for this training.

 - A user for the Identity Authorization service (IAS) used in this training. IAS is the authentication service that is used to access the training environment for SAP Work Zone and SAP Business Application Studio.


## Details
### You will learn
  How to access SAP Work Zone


In this workshop tutorial mission, you'll be accessing the SAP Work Zone tutorial environment from a SAP BTP subaccount that has already been set up for you including a subscription to SAP Work Zone. Once you've accessed SAP Work Zone, in the next tutorial, you'll create a workspace and add content to it.

>Please note that due to the high number of participants that register for SAP Work Zone workshops, we have provided a single subaccount for multiple users. Therefore, you will be using a shared subaccount with others. In order to allow the exercises to run smoothly for all, please don't edit the SAP Work Zone Home page as it's a shared asset.

>Important: To work on this shared environment, you'll need to use a unique identifier for some entity names. This is important so that you can identify your entities. We have specified in each of the tutorials of this mission when this is relevant. For example, we will tell you to add your unique identifier like this: `<your unique identifier>_<name of entity>`.
