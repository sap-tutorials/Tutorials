  How to access SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition


## Intro
In this workshop tutorial mission, you'll be accessing the SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition tutorial environment from a SAP BTP subaccount that has already been set up for you, including a subscription to SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition service. Once you've accessed the service, in the next tutorial, you'll create a workspace in your site and add content to it.

>This workshop is conducted on a shared environment. Therefore we will be asking you to enter unique IDs in some of the steps. We have specified in each of the tutorials of this mission when to enter your unique ID. For example, `<your unique identifier>_<name of entity>`. In addition, please don't edit the **Home** page as it's a shared asset.  

>Please note that SAP Launchpad service and SAP Work Zone come together under the SAP Build Work Zone brand, with two editions: standard edition (formerly SAP Launchpad service) and advanced edition (formerly SAP Work Zone).
 This means, SAP Work Zone was recently renamed to `SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition`.
