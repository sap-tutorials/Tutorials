[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Configure Maven)]

1. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

2. From the Eclipse menu bar choose **Window** > **Preferences** > **Maven** > **User Settings** and select the **User Settings** node.

3. If you are using Maven for the first time, you need to create a `settings.xml` file at location `C:/Users//.m2/settings.xml` for Windows users and
`/Users//.m2/settings.xml` for Mac OS users.
You can use the sample snippet below that shows you where you should specify the proxy server in the `settings.xml` file.

4. If you have already installed Maven before, you can click on the **open file** link and add the proxy configuration to your `settings.xml` if it is not already there.
Note that if you are not working behind a proxy, you can remove the entire proxy section from the snippet.


```
 <settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
     <localRepository>${user.home}/.m2/repository</localRepository>
     <profiles>
