[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Acquire SAP Cloud Platform)]

The simplest way to get the set of required accounts is to register at [http://www.sapstore.com/](https://www.sapstore.com/) and purchase SAP IoT there. This way all of the communication relative to the setup will reach you directly based on your email address.

You will receive a so-called s-user (user id is starting with s) and a global account via email. At this point it's critical that you or someone you onboard to the global account as an administrator walk through the following end-to-end configuration and onboarding guide at [Getting Started with SAP IoT](https://help.sap.com/viewer/195126f4601945cba0886cbbcbf3d364/latest). Do go through all of the steps in full to make sure everything is set up correctly and you can really get started building IoT applications.

The aforementioned guide will enable you to have the following configured for you in your new global account:

- A Cloud Foundry sub-account and space to allow you to subscribe to services, store data and deploy applications with the help of IoT
- An instance of IoT (device management) for Cloud Foundry that allows you to manage IoT devices securely and onboard them with different protocols
- A NEO sub-account to allow you to use the Full-Stack Web IDE service for building HTML5 based user interfaces
- All the necessary configuration and a minimum set of roles assigned to your user so you can make use of all of the above

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Acquire prototyping hardware)]

If you need hardware for prototyping or subsequent tutorials, we recommend you acquire a typical raspberry pi based kit to get started for example at [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15361](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15361) and digital sensors for light, temperature and humidity (e.g. [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14459](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14459), [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15436](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15436) and [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10167](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10167)). Of course, you can choose any device hardware or any supplier but the subsequent tutorials will be based on this example containing a temperature, humidity and light sensor.
