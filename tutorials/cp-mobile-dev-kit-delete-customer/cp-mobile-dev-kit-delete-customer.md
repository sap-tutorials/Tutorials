[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Store the deleted record locally)]

The next step is to store deleted record locally for an offline application or delete directly back to the backed for online applications. You will now create an OData delete action to delete a customer record. You will also show a failure message if the delete action fails.

1. Define a failure message action for displaying a message in case deleting of a customer fails.

    Right-click the **Actions** folder | **MDK: New Action** | choose **MDK Message Actions** in **Category** | click **Message Action** | **Next**.

    !![MDK](img_1.1.png)

    Provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Action Name`| `DeleteCustomerEntityFailureMessage` |
    | `Type` | Select `Message` from the dropdown |
    | `Message` | `Delete entity failure - {#ActionResults:delete/error}` |
    | `Title` | `Delete Customer` |
    | `OKCaption` | `OK` |
    | `OnOK` | `--None--` |
    | `CancelCaption` | leave it blank |
    | `OnCancel` | `--None--` |

    !![MDK](img_1.2.png)

    >In this expression `{#ActionResults:delete/error}`, _delete_ is a reference to the **Action Result** name in the _Delete Entity action_ (you will create this action in following step). This reference is used to pass the results to subsequent actions in the chain. These actions can reference the action result as needed. In this case if there is a failure, you access the error property of the action result to display the OData failure message.

    >This is the standard Binding Target Path (also called Dynamic Target Path) syntax used when you need to include a binding with other bindings or within a string as used in the message here.

    >You could exclude above expression and can just display a generic message.

    Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the Confirmation step.

    >Ignore the error *cannot get action result for delete* as *delete* reference is currently missing, it will be fixed after sub-step 3.

2. Next, you will create the **OData Delete action** to delete a customer record.

    >You can find more details about [Delete Entity Action](https://help.sap.com/doc/69c2ce3e50454264acf9cafe6c6e442c/Latest/en-US/docs-en/reference/schemadoc/Action/ODataService/DeleteEntity.schema.html).

    Right-click the **Actions** folder | **MDK: New Action** | choose **MDK Data Actions** in **Category** | click **OData Action** | **Next**.

    !![MDK](img_1.4.png)

    Provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Action Name`| `Customers_DeleteEntity` |
    | `Type` | Select `DeleteEntity` from the dropdown |
    | `Service`| Select `Sample.service` from the dropdown |
    | `EntitySet` | Select `Customers` from the dropdown |
    | `ReadLink`| click link icon and double click `readLink` |

    !![MDK](img-1.5.png)

    >The `readLink` is a direct reference to an individual entity set entry.

    Click **Next** and **Finish** on the confirmation screen. The action editor will open with the `Customers_DeleteEntity.action` loaded.

3. Next, define _Success_ and _Failure_ actions for `Customers_DeleteEntity.action`.

    In the action editor for the new action, expand the **Common Action Properties** and provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Action Result`| `delete` |
    | `Success Action` | Click the link icon and bind it to `CloseModalPage_Complete.action` |
    | `Failure Action` | Click the link icon and bind it to `DeleteCustomerEntityFailureMessage.action` |

    !![MDK](img-1.6.png)

    >When `Customers_DeleteEntity.action` gets executed successfully then `CloseModalPage_Complete.action` will be triggered or if `Customers_DeleteEntity.action` fails then `DeleteCustomerEntityFailureMessage.action` will be triggered.

    >`delete` value for **Action Result** is reference to `DeleteCustomerEntityFailureMessage.action` created in sub-step 1.

    >You could also show a success message for `Success Action` or chain a message to success of `CloseModalPage_Complete.action`.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create a new dialog confirmation)]

In the MDK editor, you will write a rule in JavaScript called `Customers_DeleteConfirmation.js` to display a dialog to confirm if user wants to delete current record. On it's confirmation, _customer delete entity action_ is executed.

1. Right-click the **Rules** folder | **MDK: New Rule File** | select **Empty JS Rule**.

    !![MDK](img_2.1.png)

2. Enter the Rule name `Customers_DeleteConfirmation`, click **Next** and then **Finish** on the confirmation step.

    Copy and paste the following code.

    ```JavaScript
    export default function DeleteConfirmation(context) {
    	let dialogs = context.nativescript.uiDialogsModule;
    	return dialogs.confirm("Delete current record?").then((result) => {
    		if (result === true) {
    			return context.executeAction('/DemoSampleApp/Actions/Customers_DeleteEntity.action').then(
    				(success) => Promise.resolve(success),
    				(failure) => Promise.reject('Delete entity failed ' + failure));
    		} else {
    			return Promise.reject('User Deferred');
    		}
    	});
    }
    ```

    >In above code there is a reference to `Customers_DeleteEntity.action` , you can navigate directly from here to the MDK file by right clicking on it.

3. Save the changes.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Add a trash button to customer details page)]

You will add a button to the _Customer Detail page_ called **Trash**. You will link this button to the `Customers_DeleteConfirmation.js` rule you just created. This event will display a dialog when the **Trash** button is pressed by the end-user.

1. In `Customers_Detail.page`, drag and drop an **Action Bar Item** to the upper right of the action bar.

    !![MDK](img_3.1.png)

    >**Action Bar Item** is a button that users can use to fire actions when pressed. You can add an Action Bar Item only to the Action Bar (at the top of the page).

    Click the **link icon** to open the object browser for the **System Item** property.

    Double click the **Trash** type and click **OK**.

    !![MDK](img-3.2.png)

2. Next, click the **Events** tab, click the 3 dots icon for the `OnPress` property to open the **Object Browser**.

    Double click the `Customers_DeleteConfirmation.js` rule and click **OK** to set it as the `OnPress` Action.

    >You could link `OnPress` property directly to OData delete action directly instead to this JavaScript file. Idea of linking to  JavaScript file is to let you understand another way to achieve similar functionality.

    !![MDK](img-3.3.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Deploy the application)]

Deploy the updated application to your MDK client.

1. Right-click `Application.app` and select **MDK: Deploy**.

    !![MDK](img-4.1.png)

2. Select deploy target as **Mobile & Cloud**.

    !![MDK](img-4.2.png)

    You should see success message for both deployments.
