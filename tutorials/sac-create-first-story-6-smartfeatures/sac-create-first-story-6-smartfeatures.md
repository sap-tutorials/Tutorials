### Run a Smart Insight


Let's run Smart Insights on the Gross Margin per Product Category chart to help us better understand the data within the chart.  

**1.** Click the **Chart Action Menu** of the Gross Margin per Product Category chart  

**2.** Click **Add Smart Insights**

![Smart Insight 1](Smart Insight 1 new.png)

Smart Insights then analyzes the underlying dataset and runs various statistical algorithms to uncover the top contributors influencing Gross Margin per Product Category.

**3.** Click **View Moreâ€¦**

![Smart Insight 2](Smart Insight 2.png)

The Smart Insights panel will then appear on the right to display insights specific to the selected data point or variance.

### Run a Smart Discovery


Smart Discovery analyzes your data by running a machine learning algorithm to help you explore your data in a specific context, to uncover new, or unknown relationships between columns within a dataset.

**5.** Click **Smart Discovery** under **More** in the Tool bar

You will then be prompted to set your topic by choosing a Target and Entity.

> - The **Target** is the measure or dimension you'd like to know more about.
> - The **Entity** defines the dimension(s) you'd like to explore in relation to the target, and the level to which Smart Discovery must aggregate your data to analyze it for you.

**6.**	Set **Sales Revenue** as the Target  

**7.**	Include **Manager**, **Product Category**, **Product Line**, and **Product Name** as the Entities to explore in relation to the Target  

**8.**	Click **Run**

> Currently, you can't run Smart Discovery on more than one million cells. If this is a problem in your future endeavors, you can filter the data to reduce the number of cells included in your dataset.



### Analyze and Gain New Insights


Smart Discovery will then generate up to four new pages that will be added to your story:  

### Overview
This page provides visualizations to summarize the results of the target, in this case, Sales Revenue.

### Key Influencers
Using classification and regression techniques, key influencers are ranked from highest to lowest based on their influence on our target, Sales Revenue.

### Unexpected Values
This page shows information on outliers in your data with a table showing the expected and actual values from the predictive model. A scatter plot and bar chart then displays these outliers.  

> This page is only displayed if there are unexpected values.

### Simulation
This page allows users to test hypothetical scenarios by toggling key influencers in an interactive what-if simulation. Let's try it out.

**9.** Increase the Discount toggle from `715,862.01` to `867,354.83`  

**10.** Click **Simulate**

![Simulation](Simulation.gif)

With an increased discount of $151,492.82 on our products, the model simulated that our target, Sales Revenue, would increase by 18%. This is a good example of testing a hypothetical scenario to develop a sales strategy.
