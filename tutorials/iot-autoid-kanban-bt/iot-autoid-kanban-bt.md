## Prerequisites
- You have licensed SAP Internet of Things (with the new capacity unit based licensing introduced in August 2020, your company has a Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement or Pay-As-You-Go for SAP BTP and you have subscribed to the `oneproduct` service plan)
 - You have setup the subscription for SAP IoT in your global account in a tenant (e.g. in the DEV tenant, the guide for the basic setup is at [Get Started with Your SAP IoT Account](https://help.sap.com/viewer/195126f4601945cba0886cbbcbf3d364/latest/en-US/bfe6a46a13d14222949072bf330ff2f4.html) ).
 - Your SAP User has at a minimum the `iot_role_collection` created during onboarding of your tenant and the associated roles (see [SAP Help on Providing Authorizations in](https://help.sap.com/viewer/195126f4601945cba0886cbbcbf3d364/latest/en-US/2810dd61e0a8446d839c936f341ec46d.html ) )
 - You have created destinations for the SAP S/4HANA or SAP S/4HANA Cloud kanban APIs as described in [Create Destinations for Kanban APIs](iot-autoid-kanban-destination)

## Details
### You will learn
  - What the new Fiori Apps on Smart Sensing in SAP Internet of Things are about
  - How to active a pre-delivered Business Template
  - How the Business Templates help you to get started with Smart Sensing easily

Smart Sensing Services in SAP Internet of Things allow you to enable business processes based on Auto-ID Events (e.g. EPCIS events). Those events are usually captured by RFID scanners, gates or similar hardware. The hardware can be connected directly to SAP IoT using MQTT or REST or via a 3rd party gateway.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Get to know Smart Sensing Fiori apps)]
As of the 2104b version of SAP Internet of Things four new Fiori Apps on Smart Sensing have been released.

!![Smart Sensing Apps in Fiori Launchpad](SmartSensing.png)

  - **Business Context**

      Here you can set up a data connection to any business system e.g. SAP S/4HANA Cloud and specify the business objects that you're interested in (e.g. kanban container). The selected business objects are then used in the subsequent steps.

  - **Business Context Hierarchy**

      Here you can specify the relationships between various business objects selected in the **Business Context** app. This is a prerequisite for being able to properly fetch all related business objects in the right sequence. Furthermore, you configure when and for which objects the data load should happen.

  - **Auto-ID Event Enrichment**

      Here you can configure the enrichment of incoming scanning events with information form the business objects (e.g. Kanban Container) as well as with additional properties that have been collected in the scanning event. This enriched Auto-ID events can then be used to design and run rules on them.

  - **Line of Business Templates**

      In this app, you can choose between various predefined templates (e.g. Kanban Scenario) representing selected business scenarios. You are going to use this app in the next steps.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Activate the kanban business template)]
Open the Fiori launchpad and Navigate to the **IoT Rules and Actions** tab and start to the app **Line of Business Templates** and click **Execute** for the **Kanban** scenario:

!![Start Line of Business Templates App](ActivateTemplate1.png)

  1.    On the next screen select your **Package** (in this example a package with name  **`sap.tutorial`** is used ) and your **Destination** created in the previous Tutorial [Create Destinations for kanban APIs](iot-autoid-kanban-destination) and move on to **Step 2**:

    !![Select your package and destination](ActivateTemplate2.png)

  2.    In **Step 2** set the flag for creating sample Auto-ID Event Enrichments and move on to **Step 3**:

    !![Create sample Event Enrichment](ActivateTemplate3.png)

  3.    Finally review your entries and click **Copy**:

    !![Review and press Copy](CopyTemplate.png)

This will trigger the creation of the **Business Context**, **Business Context Hierarchy** and **Auto-ID Event Enrichment** for you. You can see the result in the success message shown:

!![Review and press Copy](SuccessofTemplateCopy.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Review result of template activation)]
You can now use the Smart Sensing apps to review the objects created in Step 2:

  - **Business Context**:

  - **Business Context Hierarchy**:

  - **Auto-ID Event Enrichment**:
