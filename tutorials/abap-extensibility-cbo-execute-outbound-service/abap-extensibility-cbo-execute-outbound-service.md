# Execute an Outbound Service from Custom Business Object Logic
<!-- description --> Call an external service of SAP API Business Hub from inside the logic implementation of a custom business object.

## Prerequisites  
**Authorizations:** Your user needs
- (a) business role(s) with business catalogs **Extensibility** (ID: `SAP_CORE_BC_EXT`) and **Communication Management** (ID: `SAP_CORE_BC_COM`) in your **S/4HANA Cloud** system
- access to **[SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com)**.
**Example Objects:** Existence of custom business object `Bonus Entitlement` as described in this [tutorial](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/02/20/part-iv-associated-business-objects-bonus-entitlement-with-plan-sales-order/) (Blog)
**Knowledge:** (optional) [Tutorial: Getting started with the SAP API Business Hub](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-abh-getting-started.html)

## You will learn
- How to get needed service data from SAP API Business Hub Sandbox
- How to configure outbound service connection in SAP S/4HANA Cloud system
- How to call and process an outbound service in custom business object logic

## Intro
The example application of `Bonus Entitlement` will be enhanced by a feedback functionality. The manager's feedback will be translated automatically into English by calling the externally available service **Machine Translation API** of SAP.
> Be aware that the example is done with SAP API Business Hub Sandbox system only. This shall only give an idea on how it works and cannot be used productively.
## Additional Information

    | **`Feedback in english`** | **`FeedbackInEnglish`** | **`Text`** | Length: **`255`** |

7. **Publish** the business object.


### Open custom business object logic

Now as the business object has just been published, the logic can be enhanced by the translation functionality. ABAP for key users was enhanced by the classes `CL_BLE_HTTP_CLIENT`, `CL_BLE_HTTP_REQUEST` and `CX_BLE_HTTP_EXCEPTION` to enable you to work with HTTP requests.

1. Switch to **Logic** section.

    ![Switch to Logic section](CBO_LogicSection.png)

2. Enter the **After Modification** Event Logic.

    ![Enter After Modification logic](CBO_go2AfterModify.png)


### Code HTTP client creation


1. In the already existing coding go to the end but before this snippet

    ```abap
        ELSE.
            RETURN.
        ENDIF.
    ENDIF.
    ```
2. Implement a check if the outbound service is available

    ```abap
    * Check if the outbound service is available
    CHECK cl_ble_http_client=>is_service_available(
        communication_scenario = 'YY1_MACHINE_TRANSLATION_API'
        outbound_service       = 'YY1_OS_MACHINE_TRANSLATION_API_REST'
    ) = abap_true.
    ```
3. Implement creation of HTTP client

    ```abap
    * Create HTTP client to access the outbound service
    DATA(lo_client) = cl_ble_http_client=>create(
        communication_scenario = 'YY1_MACHINE_TRANSLATION_API'
        outbound_service       = 'YY1_OS_MACHINE_TRANSLATION_API_REST'
    ).
    ```


### Code request body string

Implement the creation of the Request Body.
As the aim is to translate every other language than english into english, the target language is set to english. The source language and the to be translated feedback are gotten from the corresponding fields of the custom business object.
The request body in JSON format looks this way.

```json
{
  "sourceLanguage": "es",
  "targetLanguages": [
    "en"
  ],
  "units": [
    {
      "value": "Su texto a traducir"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the custom business object logic you have to supply this request as string. The `sourceLanguage` and `value` values have to be replaced with variables by string concatenation.


```abap
DATA lv_request_body TYPE string.
CONCATENATE '{"sourceLanguage": "' bonus_entitlement-feedbackslanguage '","targetLanguages": ["en"],"units": [{"value": "' bonus_entitlement-feedback '"}]}' INTO lv_request_body.
```


### Code service request creation

Create the service request and set several properties

```abap
* Creation of the service request
DATA(request) = cl_ble_http_request=>create(
* method that is used for the service call
)->set_method(
    if_ble_http_request=>co_method-post
)->set_body( lv_request_body
)->set_header_parameter(
EXPORTING
    name  = 'apikey'
    value = '<YOUR API KEY>' "the key you got with Step 1
)->set_header_parameter(
EXPORTING
    name  = 'Content-Type' "Content type the bodies of request and response are formatted as
    value = 'application/json'
    ).
```


### Code request sending and response processing


1. Implement sending the request by the use of the before created HTTP client and receive the response.

    ```abap
    * Send a request and receive a response.
	    DATA(response) = lo_client->send( request ).
    ```

2. Implement getting the response body from the response.

    ```abap
    * Get the body of the response.
    	DATA(lv_body) = response->get_body( ).
    ```
    The response body in JSON format will look like this

    ```json
    {
        "units": [
            {
                "value": "Su texto a traducir",
                "translations": [
                    {
                        "language": "en",
                        "value": "Your text to be translated"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

3. Implement getting the translation part from the JSON string by the help of string operations.

    ```abap  
    * Get translation from response
        DATA(lv_translation) = substring_before( val = substring_after( val = lv_body sub = '"en","value":"') sub = '"}]}]}' ).

        bonus_calculation-feedbackinenglish = lv_translation.
    ```
4. Implement error handling

    ```abap
    TRY .
    " CODING PARTS OF THIS STEP FROM BEFORE TO BE PLACED HERE
    	CATCH cx_ble_http_exception INTO DATA(lx).
    * The http status code can be checked.
    	CASE lx->status_code.
    	WHEN 404.
    * Error handling
    	WHEN OTHERS.
    * Error handling
    	ENDCASE.
    ENDTRY.
```
5. Publish the After Modification logic.


### Test the application

1. Go to **Home** of your SAP S/4HANA system's Fiori Launchpad.

    ![Fiori Home Button](FioriHomeButton.png)

2. Open the **Bonus Entitlement** application from **Extensibility** Launchpad group.

3. Open a `Bonus Entitlement`.

4. Enter following data

    | Field Label | Field Value |
    | :------------- | :--------------------------- |
    | Feedback | **`Su texto a traducir`** |
    | Feedback's Language | **`es`** |

5. **Save** the Bonus Entitlement. The translation will get filled.
